title: What is an RSE?
---

We like an inclusive definition of Research Software Engineers to encompass those who regularly use expertise in programming to advance research. This includes researchers who spend a significant amount of time programming, full-time software engineers writing code to solve research problems, and those somewhere in-between.  We aspire to apply the skills and practices of software development to research to create more robust, manageable, and sustainable research software.

[We also like the UK definition](https://rse.ac.uk/what-is-an-rse/).
