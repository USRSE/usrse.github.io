We are thrilled to announce that US-RSE has received a two-year grant, totaling nearly $800k, from The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation!

This grant represents a major turning point in our organization's growth and will enable many new community initiatives, programs, and events over the coming years.
We would like to express our deep gratitude to the Sloan Foundation for their generous support of US-RSE.
It is a testament to the work that we are doing in the community, and we are honored to be recognized in this way.

More information will be available soon, including specific plans, programs, and opportunities to get involved. 

We will post updates to the website, Slack, and email over the next few weeks.
Additionally, we will host a special [Community Call](https://princeton.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUud-qvrjMrHdz4NeQEdStLdIhMCPyT1ihr) on Thursday April 20 at 2ET/1CT/12MT/10PT to outline upcoming plans as well as provide an opportunity to answer any questions you may have. 
This call will be recorded and shared internally on Slack.

Thank you all for your ongoing support of, and participation in, US-RSE. 
Together, we can continue to make a difference for Research Software Engineers in the US.
