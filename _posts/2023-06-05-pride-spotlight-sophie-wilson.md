US-RSE's [DEI working group (DEI-WG)](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/) is proud to
help US-RSE celebrate and participate in [Pride
Month](https://www.loc.gov/lgbt-pride-month/). Each week during Pride Month,
the US-RSE will spotlight a member of the LGBTQIA+ community who has been
involved in computing, science, engineering, and/or math, and have inspired our
members through their accomplishments in their careers and their personal
stories.

## This week’s Pride Month spotlight features Sophie Wilson

Many of us are aware of the different companies that develop CPUs such as Intel
and AMD. But did you know that one of the creators for the first ever ARM
Processor was a member of the LGBTQIA+ community?

Sophie Wilson, born in 1957 in Leeds, England, has been involved in computing
applications since her young years. According to an article from the Computer
History Museum[^chm1], Sophie studied computer science at Cambridge in the
mid-1970s, after which she created the [Acorn System
1](https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/11288/Acorn-System-1/), a commercial
8-bit system geared towards computing hobbyists sold by Acorn Computers. While
working at Acorn in 1985, she also co-developed the ARM processor, which is
still in use in most of today’s smartphones and which powered the world’s
fastest supercomputer in 2020-2022:
[Fujitsu](https://www.arm.com/blogs/blueprint/fujitsu-a64fx-arm).

Sophie Wilson is also a transgender woman. She transitioned from male to female
in 1994 and is a beacon for transgender members of the computing community. So
while you read this blog post on your smartphone or playing a classic video
game on your [Raspberry

send thanks to Sophie for her transcendental work in processor architecture!
