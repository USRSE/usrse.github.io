The US-RSE Association has grown to become a major resource for RSEs and
people in RSE-like roles. A primary area of support is in organizing
meetings including monthly community calls and working groups. Because
of the distributed nature of the research software engineering community
across the United States, exaggerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the
shift to remote work, most US-RSE activities now take place online.
However, co-location and face-to-face meetings have certain advantages
for local community building and fostering social connections.

During the [2022 US-RSE Community Building Workshop](https://us-rse.org/first-community-workshop/),
a working group was established to identify pathways for creating a network
of RSE groups based on geographic areas rather than institutions or companies.
The working group aims to inspire the establishment of a network
of local and regional RSE groups by creating the support structures
that enable organizing and leading such groups. The objective is to
connect research software engineers within their local communities
in ways that aren't possible through virtual interactions.

The Local and Regional Working Group consists of the following members:

| Name              | Organization                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Abbey Roeloff     | University of Michigan           |
| Jordan Perr-Sauer | National Renewable Energy Lab    |
| Mahmood Shad      | Harvard University               |
| Rafael Mudafort   | National Renewable Energy Lab    |
| Sandra Gesing     | University of Illinois - Chicago |

A few members of the working group are conducting an ongoing experiment in
establishing local RSE groups in our own areas while also sharing
resources, successes and failures. If you are interested in creating a local or
regional RSE group or you have already done so and would like to
share your experiences with the US-RSE community, please reach out
through the [US-RSE Slack](http://usrse.slack.com)!


## Why start a local group? Why would anyone participate?

In a recent informal poll of the members of the
[Front Range Slack channel](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C01FSJ1QYFR),
the following reasons were identified:

- Get to know other RSEs in my area.
- Build my network and make connections.
- Venue for recruiting.
- Learn how to build RSE community at my own institution.
- Opportunities for collaboration, co-working, or a hackerspace.
- Skill and knowledge sharing.

These reasons show one theme in common: RSEs desire to be more connected
with a professional community. The need comes from the reality that RSEs
are often isolated in their organization. A local group can provide an outlet
for sharing technical knowledge and resources while bringing people together
from those cities and surrounding cities and affiliations. For example,
it can be helpful to learn about how other people use a particular tool
like an IDE or which processes are particularly useful at another institution.
Even when an organization does have a healthy network of RSEs, socializing
with co-workers can have particular limitations. A local RSE group can provide
an opportunity to socialize with other people that have a shared experience
without the "co-worker" label. A local RSE group is a great way to stay
connected to who is doing what in the area. It's an opportunity to create
a local community of RSEs who support each other throughout their careers.

## Resources

The US-RSE Association is well-established and has many resources to help
in advertising and coordinating local RSE groups. Since the US-RSE Community
Building Workshop, the Local and Regional Working Group has met regularly
and identified the following activities that enable establishing and
leading a local group:

### Formation of the Local and Regional Working Group

The working group has been formed and is using the private Slack channel
`#wg-local-regional` for organization. The working group meets monthly.
If you are interested in joining the working group, reach out to the authors
of this post via Slack.

### Support for local groups by the members of the working group

Some members of the working group will experiment by forming a local group
in their own community. Since this is a new step for US-RSE, we intend
to experiment ourselves and share our experience in a future post.
Additionally, we will engage with anyone starting their own local
group to offer resources and guidance as well as understand their
own unique experience.

### Regional group listings

The general US-RSE Slack can be used to host a local-group Slack
channel. By convention, these all are prefixed with `#rg-` followed by
the name of the location; for example, `#rg-nola` for the New
Orleans regional group. The following local and regional groups already
exist in Slack. The membership counts are accurate as of the
publication date of this post.

| Location | Slack Channel | Membership |
|---|---|---|
| Arizona | `arizona-rse` | 17 |
| California | `california-rse` | 38 |
| Chicago Area, Illinois | `rg-chicago-rse` | 8 |
| Denver Area, Colorado (Front Range) | `rg-frontrange` | 29 |
| New England | `rg-new-england` | 13 |
| New Mexico | `new-mexico-rse` | 9  |
| New Orleans, LA (NOLA) | `rg-nola` | 3  |
| Pennsylvania | `pennsylvania-rse` | 7  |

Additionally, a layer has been added to the membership map
showing the location of the active local groups. Each dot has an overlay
that links to the corresponding Slack channel. This allows visitors
to the map to quickly see if a local group exists in their area
and communicate via Slack. New groups can be added by engaging 
directly with this working group.
