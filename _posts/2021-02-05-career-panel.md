We've teamed up with [The Academic Data Science Alliance (ADSA)](https://academicdatascience.org/) to host an Early Career Panel on Research Software Engineering and Data Science careers in academia on February 23, 2021 at 2ET/11PT.  
The event is primarily focused on students of all levels, postdocs, and those early in their careers, but all are welcome to attend.

Registration is free! Please visit [https://academicdatascience.org/cdn/early-career-panel](https://academicdatascience.org/cdn/early-career-panel) for more information and a link to register.
