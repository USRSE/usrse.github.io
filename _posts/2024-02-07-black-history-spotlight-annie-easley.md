US-RSE's [DEI working group (DEI-WG)](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/) is proud to
help US-RSE celebrate and participate in Black History Month. Each week during
Black History Month, the US-RSE will spotlight Black/African Americans who have
been involved in computing, science, engineering, and/or math, and have
inspired our members through their accomplishments in their careers and their
personal stories.

## This week's Black History Month spotlight features Annie Easley

Some may know that the first computers in the US were women who were highly
skilled in mathematics[^jpl]. One of these "human computers" was Annie Easley, a
computer and rocket scientist who spent most of [her
career](https://www.nasa.gov/general/annie-easley-computer-scientist/)
contributing to and supporting key programs at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA)[^nasa].

In 1955, Annie Easley began her career as a "human computer" at the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the precursor to NASA, despite her
initial plans to work in the healthcare field[^nasa][^encyclopedia].

As human computers began to be replaced by machines, she developed the skills
needed to become a programming expert and supported NASA programs in aerospace
as well as green energy[^nasa][^encyclopedia]. Her contributions encompass
working on alternative energy technologies, contributing to the development of
the Centaur launch system, assessing how solar wind and energy could solve
energy problems, and developing nuclear-powered rocket systems[^encyclopedia].

Outside of being a computer and rocket scientist, Easley is known for her
dedication to tutoring and encouraging students from underrepresented
backgrounds to pursue STEM careers. She was also actively involved at NASA as
an equal employment opportunity (EEO) counselor and advocate for improving
employee morale in the workplace[^nasa][^encyclopedia].
