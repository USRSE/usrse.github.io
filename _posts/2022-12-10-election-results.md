After 135 votes, the results of the 2022 Steering Committee Election are in.  The four candidates elected to a two-year term are:

* Julia Damerow
* Rinku Gupta
* Kenton McHenry
* Miranda Mundt

We're excited to welcome three new members to the [Steering Committee](/about/steering-committee/) and to have Julia back for two more years.  Learn more about the new members from their [candidate information](/2022-11-18-sc-candidates/).

Thanks to our other excellent candidates Keith Beattie, Aaron Holmes, Lauren Milechin, Lance Parsons, and Joshua Teves for making the election a success.  All of them have helped to grow US-RSE and make it successful.  We look forward to their continued contributions.  

We extend a special thank you to Lance Parsons who was a founding member of the Steering Committee and has volunteered hundreds of hours over the past four years creating US-RSE.  We especially want to acknowledge his continuing work with the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion working group and the Code of Conduct review effort.

We also want to say a special thank you to two outgoing Steering Committee members who did not participate in the election, Daniel Katz and Chris Hill.  Both are founding members of the US-RSE and US-RSE Steering Committee.  They brought decades of experience to establish US-RSE, connect it to the broader research software community, and set US-RSE up for a bright future.  Both Dan and Chris are still leading various community activities and initiatives, so we can expect to continue to benefit from their experience and leadership.
