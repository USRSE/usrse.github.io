After 135 votes, the results of the 2022 Steering Committee Election are in.  The four candidates elected to a two-year term are:

* Julia Damerow
* Rinku Gupta
* Kenton McHenry
* Miranda Mundt

We're excited to welcome three new members to the [Steering Committee](/about/steering-committee/) and to have Julia back for two more years.  Learn more about the new members from their [candidate information](/2022-11-18-sc-candidates/).

Thanks to our other excellent candidates Keith Beattie, Aaron Holmes, Lauren Milechin, Lance Parsons, and Joshua Teves for making the election a success.  All of them have helped to grow US-RSE and make it successful.  We look forward to their continued contributions.  

We extend a special thank you to Lance Parsons who was a founding member of the Steering Committee and has volunteered hundreds of hours over the past four years creating US-RSE.  We especially want to acknowledge his continuing work with the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion working group and the Code of Conduct review effort.

We also want to thank two outgoing Steering Committee members who did not participate in the election, Daniel Katz and Chris Hill.  Both are founding members of the US-RSE Association and US-RSE Steering Committee.  They brought decades of experience to establish US-RSE, connect it to the broader research software community, and set US-RSE up for a bright future.  Both Dan and Chris are still leading various community activities and initiatives, so we can expect to continue to benefit from their experience and leadership.
