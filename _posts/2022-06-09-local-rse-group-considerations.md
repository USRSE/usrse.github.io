# Build your own local RSE

Because research software engineers may not fit into the typical bins of job-types in an organization (i.e. domain expert, researcher, computer scientist), RSE's can be isolated where there is a lack of formal support structure for people in these roles.
While national US-RSE Association has grown to become a major resource for people in a variety of RSE-like roles, the social support structure is difficult to maintain since the organization is spread across the country.
During the 2022 US RSE Community Building Workshop, a working group was established to identify pathways for creating a network of RSE groups tied to geographic areas rather than institutions or companies.
The Local / Regional Working Group are conducting an ongoing experiment in establishing groups in their own areas while also sharing resources, successes and failures.
Here, we share initial considerations and suggestions for establishing a local RSE group.
Look out for an updated post with additional information after we have all launched our own groups.
In the meantime, we hope these tips are helpful for others considering establishing a local group.
If you are interested in creating a local RSE group, please reach out and share your experience!

## Considerations

### Why start a local group? Why would anyone participate
The need comes from the reality that RSE's are often isolated in their organization.
A local group can provide an outlet for sharing technical knowledge and resources.
For example, it is helpful to learn about how other people use a particular tool like an IDE.
Even when an organization does have a healthy network of RSE's, socializing with co-workers can have its own baggage.
A local RSE group can provide an opportunity to socialize with other people that have a shared experience but do not have the "co-worker" label.
Finally, a local RSE group is a great way to keep tabs on who is doing what in the area.
It's an opportunity to create a local community of RSE's who support each other throughout their careers.

### Getting started
It may be easiest to start with piggy backing onto an existing group or meeting.
Shared event space
Shared programming
You could hijack a small crowd by getting some time to talk at another tangential meet up

### Reaching out to area RSE's
Below is an email template to get you started in reaching out to people in your area such as university lab directors or members, local government employees in data science etc, or coworking spaces or other companies that tend to attract software focused people.
