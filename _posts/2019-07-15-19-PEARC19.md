Join us in person at the [PEARC19 Conference](https://www.pearc19.pearc.org/)
there will be a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session "Building a Community
of Research Software Engineers."  The session is scheduled for 5:15pm
Monday, July 29 in the New Orleans room.  

If you'll be attending PEARC19 this is a great opportunity to discuss
US-RSE issues and connect to other members of this growing community!
