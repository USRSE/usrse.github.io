Dear US-RSE Members and Allies,

As this year ends, I’m filled with gratitude and pride for the incredible progress our vibrant US-RSE community has made. With over 3,000 members and the success of our second in-person US-RSE conference, we have strengthened our space for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual support. This event highlighted the power of a community where individuals from diverse career paths and backgrounds come together with a shared sense of purpose.

This year brought many key milestones. Continued funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has been important in solidifying our operational foundation. The launch of our Organizational Membership Program is an exciting step toward financial sustainability, fostering deeper partnerships and expanding recognition for RSEs within the research ecosystem.

Reflecting on the past year, the uncharted waters I faced as your Executive Director no longer feel so unknown, thanks to the incredible support of this community. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Steering Committee, whose dedication and hands-on contributions have been crucial to our growth and success. I’m equally thankful for the strong support of our members, my advisory board, and mentors, whose guidance and encouragement have made this journey possible.

Looking ahead, advocacy, funding, and the sustainability of US-RSE remain focal points of my work. The Steering Committee and I are committed to advancing professional development, career recognition, and innovative programs for both current and future RSEs. Globally, US-RSE continues to strengthen ties with international RSE communities, reminding us that we are part of a worldwide movement to elevate the visibility and impact of RSEs. Together, we are stronger.

As we enter the holiday season, I hope you find time to rest, recharge, and celebrate. Thank you for being part of this extraordinary journey—I’m always grateful for your ideas and input, so please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Wishing you a joyful holiday season and a happy, healthy New Year!

Warm regards,
Sandra Gesing
