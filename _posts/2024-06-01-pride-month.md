Happy Pride Month, everyone! If you are new to US-RSE this year, you haven't
gotten a chance to see our nifty US-RSE Pride Logo, graciously created for us
by [@Reed Milewicz](https://usrse.slack.com/team/U02J6HG7E81). Be sure to check
out this [article about the history of the Pride Flag and its many
variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_flag_(LGBT)#Variations)
(Wikipedia).

At US-RSE, we celebrate diversity, inclusivity, and the vibrant contributions
of the LGBTQ+ community in research software engineering. The [US-RSE's DEI
working group (DEI-WG)](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/) is proud to lead US-RSE's
participation in celebrating [Pride
Month](https://www.loc.gov/lgbt-pride-month/).

Throughout the month members of our community will be writing blog posts
recognizing compelling stories about LGBTQ+ people who have been involved in
computing, science, engineering, and/or math, and have inspired our members
through their accomplishments in their careers and their personal stories.
We'll be publishing these posts during the month of June to highlight such
people, where we talk about the person and tie their work and life to the RSE
movement.

In conjunction with the weekly blog posts, we ask the community to think about
how they will celebrate and reflect on pride this month. This will likely come
in many different forms for each individual. Checkout the resources below to
inspire your introspection throughout the month. Finally, please consider
joining us at our [bi-weekly DEI-WG
call](https://us-rse.org/events/repeated/dei-working-group-call/) (the next on
is on Wednesday, June 19th at 12PT/3ET).

We'd also like to bring to your attention the
[#lgbtq](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C056NFHET97) Slack channel: "A place
for LGBTQ+ folks to gather and chat!" During the month, this and the
[#dei-discussion](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C01C8CJQ7AP) Slack
channel, will provide space for all of us to discuss thoughts throughout
the month.
