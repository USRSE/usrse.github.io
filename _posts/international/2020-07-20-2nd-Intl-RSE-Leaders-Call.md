In 2018, the first International RSE Leaders Workshop, organized by the UK RSE Association, took place at the Alan Turing Institute in London, UK.
Amongst other successes, it saw the foundation of the Nordic RSE community and helped improve access to software expertise in research.

This year, representatives from existing Research Software Engineering associations - UK RSE, de-RSE, US-RSE, Nordic-RSE, NL-RSE,
and the newly founded Belgian RSE initiative - are organizing the 2nd International RSE Leaders Workshop.
The online meeting takes place on 15, 16 and 30 September, and brings together established and aspiring leaders from the
international Research Software Engineering community for a three-half-days event of networking, knowledge exchange, and hands-on collaboration.

This is the perfect opportunity to meet with key representatives from established RSE communities from around the world.
The meeting will provide aspiring leaders with the knowledge and contacts needed to establish research software engineering
communities in their own countries, and will advance our shared goal of software becoming a first-class research output.

**If you want to start an RSE initiative or association, this workshop is for you!**

Places at the workshop are strictly limited. We are looking for applications from people with a vision to start or advance a Research
Software Engineering community in their own region or country, or within a specific domain or discipline. Here, eagerness is more
important than seniority.

Apply for participation by 30 July at [https://bit.ly/intl-rse-leaders-2020-application](https://bit.ly/intl-rse-leaders-2020-application).
