# **US-RSE Updated Mission Statement**

Led by the DEI working group and unanimously approved by the US-RSE Steering Committee, we have added a fourth element to our formal [organizational mission](https://us-rse.org/mission/):

> 4\. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
>
>We will actively promote, encourage, and improve diversity throughout the broader US Research Software Engineer Community consistent with our full DEI mission statement. We will ensure we provide an inclusive environment with equitable treatment for all and we will prioritize a program of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) activities for our organization, led by a dedicated team of active community members.

This is expanded upon in the [full DEI mission statement](https://us-rse.org/dei-mission/). We are excited to add this additional element to our organization mission to help direct our actions. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the development of this important effort.

<a name="agm"></a>
# **Election of Steering Committee Members and Second Annual General Meeting**

In December 2020 we elected half of the US-RSE Steering committee, and this December, we will hold an election for the remaining five seats, so that in the future we will have a full set of two-year-term positions with half being contested each year. Watch Slack and your email for details on the election process and timeline in the coming weeks! We encourage interested members to think about running for election, and to ask any questions you might have on the [#election](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C01BC66Q16E) channel on Slack.

We will hold our second US-RSE Annual General Meeting (AGM) on December 10th, 2021, 1-3 pm ET, for all our members. This will be an opportunity to hear from US-RSE leadership about events in 2021 and future plans for the Association. Candidates running for the US-RSE Steering Committee will be given an opportunity to introduce themselves. Questions or discussion topics can be submitted prior to the meeting. All members are invited and encouraged to attend, and the meeting will be recorded and made available shortly afterwards for those who can’t make it.

# **US-RSE DEI-WG Speaker Series features The National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT)**

The US-RSE Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group (DEI-WG) is proud to present the next event in the US-RSE DEI-WG Speaker Series: [The National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT)](https://ncwit.org/)

This presentation explores why diversity matters to innovation, how implicit biases play out in technical work cultures, and what actions individuals can take to create more inclusive technical cultures. Attendees will learn key features of strategic, research-based approaches to address the biases and barriers that limit diverse participation in computing.

Date/Time: Thursday, July 29, 2021 2-3:30 pm PT (5-6:30 pm ET)

# **US-RSE Community Calls**

The video for the July Community Call on "Publication Credit for RSEs" is available at [https://youtu.be/hRh82FKGr4k](https://youtu.be/hRh82FKGr4k).

The next community call will take place on August 12, 2021. You can vote on a topic on [GitHub](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3A0%2Fproposed) by giving the topic you would like to see in the next community call a thumbs up!

<a name="workshop"></a>
# **US-RSE Community Building Workshop**

Due to COVID-19, the [US-RSE Community Building Workshop](https://us-rse.org/first-community-workshop/) has been delayed and is now scheduled for April 26-27, 2022 in Princeton NJ. As a reminder, or if you are new to US-RSE, thanks to a generous grant by The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, US-RSE is able to host this in-person workshop as a way to bring together a set of active and motivated community members to plan the best path forward to grow the US-RSE Association. More information on how to participate will be available closer to the workshop. Given the growth of the US-RSE Association (it will be over 2 years since the workshop was initially scheduled!), we’ll be reevaluating and restarting the application process. Space is limited and we are committed to ensuring a broadly diverse participant group, both in terms of traditional diversity measures as well as research domain and institutional representation. We expect great things to come from this workshop as we’ll be working together to plan activities and generate content for the community and the us-rse.org website that promotes and supports current/future RSEs in alignment with the mission of the US-RSE Association.

# **Podcast**

The Research Software Engineer Stories podcast has three new episodes. Check them out below!

After 21 terrific episodes, co-host Peter Schmidt recorded his final RSE story recently.  A special thank you to Peter for his wonderful contributions! However, this also means that RSE Stories is looking for a new co-host and other volunteers to help with production. You don’t need to commit to anything: start with one episode and go from there. Interested? Reach out to Vanessa via Slack (@v).

# **International RSE Survey**

Keep an eye out for the next International RSE Survey in the next few weeks. Last run in 2018, this survey is a multi-lingual worldwide effort led by Simon Hettrick to better understand Research Software Engineers. The results of the survey will be incredibly valuable and US-RSE plans to use the US-specific results to help direct our organizational activities and focus. Please take the time to participate and spread the word to your RSE colleagues. We will send mail with a link when it is available.

# **Research Study on Research Computing and Data Workforce**

The Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC) Professionalization Working Group and Northwestern University invite members of the Research Computing and Data (RCD) community (including research software engineers!) to participate in a [research study](https://carcc.org/rcd-professionalization/rcdprof-census/research-study-on-research-computing-and-data-workforce/) of the Research Computing and Data (RCD) workforce in the United States.

[The study](https://carcc.org/rcd-professionalization/rcdprof-census/research-study-on-research-computing-and-data-workforce/) aims to provide the first large data set on the composition of the RCD workforce in terms of demographics, job responsibilities, job types, compensation, and perceptions of the RCD field. The study is limited to the United States due to varying data privacy laws and research requirements internationally. The survey results will be widely shared with the community.

The survey takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.[ Take the Survey](https://northwestern.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8345y1KCls4nNci).

# **Interesting Events**

Some other events coming up may be of interest to RSEs:

* [SeptembRSE](https://septembrse.society-rse.org/) will take place from September 6th - 30th, 2021. The entire conference online and the organizers embrace the flexibility achievable for online events to spread all of the sessions out so that they will occupy the whole of September. All sessions will be streamed, recorded and published so that the material can be  explored throughout September at a time that is best for everyone. The programme consists of keynotes, talks, posters, walkthroughs, workshops, panels, discussions, and networking sessions. It is also planned to run some blended sessions with local RSE groups who are interested in mixing screenings of SeptembRSE events with local talks and networking.
