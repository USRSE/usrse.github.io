# üîä **2. Executive Director's Update: State of AI in the Workplace**
<!-- Add monthly theme / highlight -->

Sandra has worked with the Academic Data Science Alliance on the proposal ‚ÄúState of AI at the Workplace‚Äù and we received the funding! There will be Birds of the Feather (BoFs) and USRSE‚Äô25 and RSECon‚Äô25 in the UK. We plan for more also at SC25 and more interactive events. The survey ‚ÄúGenerative AI at the Workplace‚Äù is also part of it.

> The goals of this project as well as the survey are to capture broad ‚Äústate of the field‚Äù information and to help define topic areas for a set of convenings with the RSE community over the coming year. These convenings are intended to dig into the details of AI use in the RSE workplace: to understand what‚Äôs already happening, identify key challenges and opportunities, and explore how RSEs themselves can actively shape the future of AI-augmented research software engineering.

Please take a moment to fill out the 5-minute survey [here](https://form.jotform.com/251737608797069?utm_source=ADSA&utm_campaign=af84474998-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_02_02_06_24_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_5401c7226a-af84474998-353402058).

# üõû **3. Steering Committee Updates**

<!-- Fill in with current Steering Committee news -->

In July, the Steering Committee focused on several operational and strategic efforts. We spent significant time discussing the logistics of facilitating funding for the conference, specifically travel for students and early career participants. In collaboration with Sandra, we outlined key priorities for our new Interim Project Manager. This is a temporary role, expected to last approximately six months, and will differ in scope and focus from the previous Community Manager position. We also have been preparing and participating in the development of two important surveys: (1) an internal US-RSE community survey and, (2) the next iteration of the International RSE survey. Both surveys will help us better understand and serve both our members and the broader RSE community. Lastly, we have been working through some ongoing challenges related to external funding and the processes and procedures of fiscal sponsorship.

### INTERSECT 2025 Bootcamp (via @cosden Ian Cosden!)

The 3rd year of **INTERSECT: Research Software Engineering Training** brought together another awesome cohort of graduate students, postdocs, and early-career researchers for a week-long deep dive into intermediate and advanced research software engineering (RSE) practices.

The 4.5 day bootcamp of intensive, hands-on training is designed to engage participants with topics critical to building sustainable, reproducible, and collaborative research software. The curriculum emphasizes:

- **Software design principles** like modularity and functional independence  
- **Testing infrastructure**, like unit testing and continuous integration with tools like TravisCI and Jenkins  
- **Collaboration techniques** using GitHub workflows (pull requests, code review, issue tracking)  
- **Software packaging & distribution** for real-world deployment and community reuse  
- **Documentation strategies** using tools like Sphinx and Doxygen  

By targeting those with an existing foundation in research software development, the bootcamp fosters a unique environment where participants could immediately apply best practices to their own work‚Äîand return to their institutions as local leaders in research software sustainability. Congratulations to Ian and the team at Princeton University for another successful bootcamp!

    title="Call for abstracts: Research Software Engineers in HPC (RSE-HPC-2025)" 
    preamble="
To be held as part of SC25, St. Louis, MO, USA and online, Sunday, November 16, 2025, 8:30 am - 5:00 pm CST (UTC-6)

**=== Overview ===**

Research software engineers (RSEs) are critical to the impact of HPC, data science, and the larger scientific community. They have existed for decades, though often not under that name. The past several years, however, have seen the development of the RSE concept, common job titles, and career paths; the creation of professional networks to connect RSEs; and the emergence of RSE groups at universities, national laboratories, and industry.
This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders. We'll hear about successes and challenges that RSEs and RSE groups have experienced, and discuss ways to increase awareness of RSE opportunities and improve support for RSEs.

The workshop will be highly interactive, featuring breakout discussions and panels, as well as invited addresses and submitted talks.

**=== Submissions ===**

We encourage prospective participants to submit abstracts of proposed lightning talks (limit of 1 page, no format prescribed) on topics related to RSE issues. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

- Career paths: how should RSEs be hired, promoted and evaluated?Building RSE organizations: how to find RSEs in your country/region and how to motivate them to join the network and engage?
- Supporting RSE organizations: what can be done to help RSEs (and those supporting RSEs) at international, national, regional, and local levels?
- Making the business case for RSEs and RSE groups: evidence, case studies, tactics
- How do we want funders to support RSE roles and activities?
- Building in RSE requirements as part of wider research infrastructure
- Providing mentoring and training for RSEs
- How will RSEs contribute to new technologies such as AI/ML, quantum computing, neuromorphic computing?

The authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to present lightning talks or participate in panel discussions at the workshop. Note that SC25 is planning an in-person event and presenting in-person is encouraged. A supporting digital experience will accommodate those who cannot attend in-person due to travel restrictions or health concerns.

We particularly encourage submissions from first-time conference presenters, and from members of groups that have historically been underrepresented in the HPC community. **The deadline for submissions is Friday, August 8, 2025, at 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12).**

    title="Building Engagement (BE) program at the 2025 US-RSE25" 
    when="October 2-8, 2025" 
    where="Philadelphia, PA"
    preamble="
Sustainable Horizons Institute is organizing a Building Engagement (BE) program at the 2025 US-Research Software Engineers (US-RSE25) conference to be held October 2-8, 2025 in Philadelphia, PA. The BE program is designed to expand the professional association by supporting students from a variety of backgrounds. BE@US-RSE25 will provide funding and special activities designed to welcome students and help them become part of the community.
BE participants are recruited from non-mainstream and smaller academic institutions. For many, US-RSE25 will be their first experience at a scientific conference. Many will be undergraduate students from minority-serving institutions, women‚Äôs and community colleges, or small liberal arts colleges. For some, attending US-RSE25 will have a dramatic impact on their future.
BE first started at the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics 2015 Computational Science and Engineering conference and has welcomed approximately 350 students and professionals into professional societies.
We are currently recruiting volunteers (unfortunately we are not able to provide funding for volunteers) for these roles:
Guided Affinity Group Leaders: work with a small group of students to help them get the most out of the conference; must already have funding to attend the conference; for more information visit the BE@US-RSE Guided Affinity Groups page.
Review Committee members: US-RSE and other computational science and engineering community members with an interest in supporting students from a variety of backgrounds and with an interest in the mission of the Building Engagement program; committee members will review applications for funded participants in late August; all work will be completed virtually in 1-2 hours
"

BE@USE-RSE25 Volunteer Application: Guided Affinity Group Leader; deadline: August 8, 2015
