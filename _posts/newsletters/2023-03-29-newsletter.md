# **Two-year Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Grant**

We are thrilled to announce that US-RSE has received a two-year grant, totaling nearly $800k, from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation!

This grant represents a major turning point in our organization’s growth and will enable many new community initiatives, programs, and events over the coming years. We would like to express our deep gratitude to the Sloan Foundation for their generous support of US-RSE. It is a testament to the work that we are doing in the community, and we are honored to be recognized in this way.

More information will be available soon, including specific plans, programs, and opportunities to get involved.

We will post updates to the website, Slack, and email over the next few weeks. Additionally, we will host a special [Community Call](https://princeton.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUud-qvrjMrHdz4NeQEdStLdIhMCPyT1ihr) on **Thursday, April 20 at 2ET/1CT/12MT/11PT** to outline upcoming plans as well as provide an opportunity to answer any questions you may have. This call will be recorded and shared internally on Slack.

Thank you all for your ongoing support of, and participation in, US-RSE. Together, we can continue to make a difference for Research Software Engineers in the US.

## RSE Group Leaders' Network (RSE-GLN)   
    
The RSE-GLN is a group of individuals leading RSE teams who meet to support their peers with the challenges of leading RSE groups.

The primary membership is for those who currently lead a team and have, or are actively in the process of hiring, at least one direct report; additional members may be invited, such as those who have been in leadership positions in the past. This is to ensure that members have a network of peers in similar situations who are facing similar challenges.  The group meets monthly.

The RSE-GLN also seeks to support aspiring RSE Group Leaders through a separate mentorship and development network. The Aspiring RSE-GLN is open to those looking to build RSE teams at their institution or move into RSE group leadership roles. There are no formal requirements, but those with the experience and qualifications to take on leadership roles will likely benefit more than early career RSEs.

# **Interesting Reads, Videos, or Podcasts**

A note from Peter Schmidt on the two year anniversary of his podcast, [Code for Thought](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com):

<blockquote>Two Years of Code for Thought
<br>
<br>
On 12 January 2021, the first episode of Code for Thought, the podcast show for research and software engineering, went live with <a href="https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/1326658/7121884-and-so-it-begins">‘And so it begins…’</a> At the time, I was quite nervous about launching the podcast. After all, I just barely started co-hosting podcast episodes with the wonderful Vanessa Sochat and her ‘RSE Stories’ show (now <a href="https://rseng.github.io/devstories/">Developer Stories</a>. On top of that, with podcasting being very popular and so many shows to choose from, where would this one end up?
<br>
<br>
Well, two years and nearly 60 episodes later, I am pleased to say the podcast has found its place. In that period the community of research software engineers has grown steadily, not only in the UK but globally.
<br>
<br>
At the same time, the questions that have puzzled us RSEs for so long still persist: How do we get recognition and proper support for the work we do? And while in some countries, like the UK, research centres and universities have been building teams of RSEs, in other countries such roles still need to be defined and funded.
<br>
<br>
All of this means that the work of raising awareness of research software engineering and growing our community must continue. And it should do so on an international level as well as on a local and national one.
<br>
<br>
Podcasting is a great way of helping to achieve that and I am delighted to continue and even increase the effort on Code for Thought. This means increasing the visibility of research and software engineering not only in the UK but elsewhere in the world.
<br>
<br>
In the annual report from the Code for Thought hosting site I read that the podcast has been listened to by people from 59 different countries. Which blew my mind away. But it also showed that the podcast needs to serve a wider community.
<br>
<br>
To keep this podcast as a true community effort it is important to hear from you! I look forward to hear about your ideas, comments and suggestions on <a href="mailto:code4thought@proton.me">email</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/codeforthought/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://ukrse.slack.com/join/signup#/domain-signup">UK Slack workspace</a> (@code4thought), <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@code4thought">Mastodon</a>, and <a href="https://code4thought-podcast.github.io/newsletters/">Github news/blogs</a>. 
<br>
<br>
My heartfelt thanks for listening and supporting this podcast. I wish you all the best for 2023 and I hope you enjoy the show.
<br>
<br>
Peter

# **US-RSE Has a New Fiscal Sponsor!**

We’re excited to announce that US-RSE has switched to a new fiscal sponsor. We are now a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](http://communityin.org/) (CI)! Our previous fiscal sponsor, Open Collective Foundation (OCF), represented an important first step allowing us to accept donations and making it possible to reimburse members for expenses they incurred on behalf of US-RSE. Moving forward, Community Initiatives’ additional tools, resources, and infrastructure will better serve US-RSE’s future organizational and financial goals.

<a name="involved"></a>
# **Get Involved**

There are lots of ways to get involved with the US-RSE community. Of course, you can [join us on Slack](https://us-rse.org/join). We’re also looking for ideas and help in many other places. See our [list of projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjVD0WkeeWZJI6yqSKyMdIjtClzolsxv75RkpLju17I/edit?usp=sharing) and let us know how you’d like to help. Help with things like the Website Committee, Social Media, Community Engagement, Fundraising, and Newsletter are all needed and welcome.

New guidance was recently released on how to create new [Affinity Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-an-affinity-group) and [Working Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-a-working-group). If you see an unmet need in the US-RSE community, we encourage you to create your own group!

As always we thank everyone who is already contributing for their help in shaping and growing the organization.
