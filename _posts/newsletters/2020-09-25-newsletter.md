# **US-RSE Community Call**

The community call beginning of September covered the topic "Hiring and interviewing for RSE positions". The primary goal of the call was to open a discussion, using the US-RSE community to help us understand both sides of hiring. We had lively discussions around topics such as what qualities hiring managers look for in candidates and how RSEs would like to be evaluated during the hiring process. More details can be found in a [blog post](https://us-rse.org/2020-09-18-community-call-hiring/). We are looking forward to building on the momentum via a working group and/or a slack channel for further discussions. The next community call will be October 8th at 1:00 pm EDT. [Zoom registration](https://princeton.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0lce6hrjkqG9OyLUKYOfGDx1eb7OxzfYGK) is available now and connection details will be shared via the mailing list and Slack. Stay tuned for more information!

# **Upcoming elections of the Steering Committee**

As the Steering Committee [shared](https://us-rse.org/2020-06-29-sc-transition/) this summer, elections for four seats on the Steering Committee will happen in December. Watch Slack and your email for details on the election process and timeline next week! We encourage interested members to sign up to be a candidate for election.

# **RSE Events at SC20**

As at previous SC conferences, there will be several events at [SC20](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/) of interest to RSEs.  We are particularly excited about the [RSE-HPC-2020](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2020/) workshop, which US-RSE is helping to organize, to be held on Thursday, November 12!  We are putting together the schedule of talks and panel discussions now, so watch for this to be posted in mid-October.

The SC20 schedule is under construction, but other relevant events include:

* Tutorial:  [Better Scientific Software](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3479&id=tut146&sess=sess275), Tuesday, November 10
* Workshop:  [4th International Workshop on Software Correctness for HPC Applications](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3479&id=wksp134&sess=sess205), Wednesday, November 11
* Birds-of-a-Feather:  Software Engineering and Reuse in Modeling, Simulation, and Data Analytics for Science and Engineering, date and time TBA.

Note also that this year’s SC is entirely online with lower registration rates, which will make participation easier than ever.  We hope you’ll be able to join us!

# **Interesting Events**

Some other events coming up may be of interest to RSEs:

* [SORSE: A Series of Online Research Software Events](https://sorse.github.io) - an international answer to the COVID-19-induced cancellation of many national RSE conferences, to provide an opportunity for RSEs to develop and grow their skills, build new collaborations and engage with RSEs worldwide. It has a rolling deadline for events to be proposed as part of the series, and the next deadline is on July 31st. The events will take place at different times to accommodate different time zones. Submitters can indicate preferred dates and times.
* [Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/#webinar045) - a webinar series that addresses issues faced by developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on high-performance computers (HPC). The sessions are independent, so you can join any or all.
* [EDUCAUSE](https://events.educause.edu/event-finder) offers webinars that support higher education to elevate the impact of IT. The webinars have a registration fee.
* [SGCI (the Science Gateways Community Institute)](https://sciencegateways.org/engage/webinars) has a monthly webinar series around science gateways, web security, sustainability of software and projects. If you would like to contribute a talk, please contact [help@sciencegateways.org](mailto:help@sciencegateways.org). SGCI additionally offers the online [Focus Week](https://sciencegateways.org/engage/focus-week) that helps software and website projects get to the next level of sustainability. "[Jumpstart Your Sustainability Plan](https://sciencegateways.org/engage/focus-week/jumpstart)" builds on experiences from the Focus Week and is a virtual mini-course addressing sustainability issues. The [Gateways 2020](https://sciencegateways.org/web/gateways2020/attend/register) Conference will take place online from October 12-23 with workshops and tutorials in the first week and the main track in the second week. Poster submissions are accepted by September 28 and registration is open until October 5.

# **RSEs in Latin America**

An effort has started to consider how possible RSEs in Latin American can become aware of the RSE movement, perhaps including forming regional, national, or local groups and communities. If you are interested in joining this discussion, it's happening in the #rse-latam channel in the [UK-RSE Slack team](http://ukrse.slack.com), to which you can [request access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9LqOWGwA1xDvSgy81eimcb9s0cNBFso0zv0_HoZz16G1M5w/viewform?c=0&w=1).

# **Better Scientific Software Fellowships**

If you have an idea for how to make scientific software better, and you are affiliated with a US institution that can receive $25,000 from the DOE, you can [apply for a Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship](https://bssw.io/pages/apply-for-the-bssw-fellowship-program), with applications due September 30th.
