# **Election of Steering Committee Members and Second Annual General Meeting**

In December 2020 we elected half of the US-RSE Steering committee, and this December, we will hold an election for the remaining five seats, so that in the future we will have a full set of two-year-term positions with half being contested each year.

[Nominations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoLAWkUqsv7axDFnaV3GEw0gRBDemqSztbxKTtGr7EE1rWqA/viewform?usp=sf_link), including self-nominations, for the US-RSE Steering Committee election are now open. Nominations are due November 5, 2021. Interested members are encouraged to nominate themselves. Alternatively, if you know of a member who you think would make a good candidate, you can submit a nomination for someone else. All US-RSE members in good standing as of October 22, 2021 (when nominations opened) are eligible to be nominated as candidates.

You can find [details on the election process and timeline here](https://us-rse.org/about/election/)! We encourage interested members to think about running for election, and to ask any questions you might have on the [#election](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C01BC66Q16E) channel on Slack.

We will hold our second US-RSE Annual General Meeting (AGM) on December 3rd, 2021, 1-3 pm ET, for all our members. This will be an opportunity to hear from US-RSE leadership about our activities in 2021 and future plans for the Association. Candidates running for the US-RSE Steering Committee will be given an opportunity to introduce themselves. Questions or discussion topics can be submitted prior to the meeting. All members are invited and encouraged to attend, and the meeting will be recorded and made available shortly afterwards for those who can’t make it.

# **First International RSE Day**

October 14 was the [First International RSE Day](https://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html), and US-RSE hosted a panel and a series of talks to celebrate the [event](https://us-rse.org/events/2021/2021-10-intnl-rse-day/). The panel and talks were recorded and the recordings will be available soon in the [US-RSE YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7IQsWv809OQYJ-sJKuQZrw/). We thank Blake Joyce as the main organizer of this well-attended event!

<a name="podcast"></a>
# **RSE Stories Podcast**

The [Research Software Engineer Stories podcast](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/) celebrates its second birthday!  There are three new episodes posted. Check them out below!

RSE Stories is looking for a new co-host and other volunteers to help with production. You don’t need to commit to anything: start with one episode and go from there. Interested? Reach out to Vanessa via Slack.

# **RSE-HPC-2021 workshop at SC21**

[**Research Software Engineers in HPC: Creating Community, Building Careers, Addressing Challenges (RSE-HPC-2021)**](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2021/) is a workshop that will be held in conjunction with [**SC21**](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/), in St. Louis, MO and virtually, on Monday, 15 November, 2021.

This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders. We’ll discuss the current activities and plans of national RSE organizations, discuss the needs of RSEs and RSE groups, and write a report on ways RSE organizations can help address these.

The [agenda](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2021/agenda/) is finalized. For more information, see the [website](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2021/) or contact the organizers at [**sc-ws-rse-hpc@info.supercomputing.org**](mailto:sc-ws-rse-hpc@info.supercomputing.org).

# **International RSE Survey**

Keep an eye out for the next International RSE Survey, coming soon. Last run in 2018, this survey is a multi-lingual worldwide effort led by Simon Hettrick to better understand Research Software Engineers. The results of the survey will be incredibly valuable and US-RSE plans to use the US-specific results to help direct our organizational activities and focus. Please take the time to participate and spread the word to your RSE colleagues. We will send mail with a link when it is available.

# **New Resource**

[Research Software Engineering with Python](https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/) by Damien Irving, Kate Hertweck, Luke Johnston, Joel Ostblom, Charlotte Wickham, and Greg Wilson

Writing and running software is now as much a part of science as telescopes and test tubes, but most researchers are never taught how to do either well. As a result, it takes them longer to accomplish simple tasks than it should, and it is harder for them to share their work with others than it needs to be. This book introduces the concepts, tools, and skills that researchers need to get more done in less time and with less pain. Based on the practical experiences of its authors, who collectively have spent several decades teaching software skills to scientists, it covers everything graduate-level researchers need to automate their workflows, collaborate with colleagues, ensure that their results are trustworthy, and publish what they have built so that others can build on it. The book assumes only a basic knowledge of Python as a starting point, and shows readers how it, the Unix shell, Git, Make, and related tools can give them more time to focus on the research they actually want to do.
