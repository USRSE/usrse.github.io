# üîä **2. Executive Director's Update**
<!-- Add monthly theme / highlight -->

### Connect with Sandra at Upcoming Events

Sandra will host office hours at our USRSE‚Äô25 conference. You can sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tkMF9arOQy-Ac94t_JEdsHWDvsB99Yj315R8QYIyGYs/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to reserve a 15-minute slot. If the timing doesn‚Äôt work out, don‚Äôt worry - she will also be around during the conference sessions and social events. Please feel free to say hello anytime!

Lastly, in November, USRSE will have a dedicated booth at The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis ([SC25](https://sc25.supercomputing.org)) in St. Louis, MO, USA, from November 17-22. Sandra will be there along with other USRSE members, and we are looking for volunteers to help out! If you are attending SC25, please let us know!

# üõû **3. Steering Committee Updates**

<!-- Fill in with current Steering Committee news -->

In September the Steering Committee largely focused on issues related to finances and the annual conference. As we're nearing the end of our initial Sloan Foundation grant funding, we looked at what areas of our budget have some room for additional spending, where we need to reallocate funds to cover expenses that were higher than anticipated, and how this all affects our budget for the coming year. We also went over the budget for the USRSE'25 conference and lessons learned from this for the USRSE'26 conference, as well as finalizing SC involvement and meetings at this year's conference. We got an update from our Executive Director about her work to get Research Software Engineer included as a job title with the Department of Labor Statistics, and we started planning for this year's Annual General Meeting and Steering Committee election.

-----------------

<a name="orgmember"></a>
# ü§ù **4. Organizational Founding Membership**

US-RSE envisions a future where Research Software Engineers are universally respected for advancing science, technology, and society through the transformative power of research software engineering.
We‚Äôre excited to share that the momentum around our Organizational Founding Membership continues to grow! See the list below for the current members (six more are onboarding at the moment).

Organizations that join on or before November 30, 2025, will be recognized in perpetuity as founding members. Founding organizations will also lock in current membership fees through December 31, 2028.
Organizational support helps sustain and expand vital community offerings, including the annual conference, monthly calls and newsletter, job board, working groups, and new resources.

Please reach out to Sandra Gesing at [sandra@us-rse.org](mailto:sandra@us-rse.org) if you are interested in becoming an organizational founding member!

#### üì¢ "Research Software Engineering: Discovering and Bridging Knowledge Gaps" is out now in IEEE Computing in Science & Engineering: [https://s.dlr.de/cise-special-issue-rseng](https://s.dlr.de/cise-special-issue-rseng).

This special issue collects work that has been started during the Dagstuhl Seminar 24161 "Research Software Engineering: Bridging Knowledge Gaps" (April 2025): [https://dagstuhl.de/24161](https://dagstuhl.de/24161).

Over 5 papers, it lays out how Research Software Engineering and Software Engineering Research should collaborate in the future for mutual benefit. RSEs can leverage state-of-the-art methods and tools from software engineering research to create better software that enables better research. SERs can gain insights into an understudied area of SE practice, and develop new research questions and agendas that produce the methods and tools required for state-of-the-art software engineering in research contexts.
The issue has been guest-edited by our community members Daniel S. Katz, Caroline Jay, Lars Grunske and Stephen Druskat.

    title="Open Innovation Sprint" 
    preamble="
Research software is the engine driving modern science and discovery. From analyzing complex datasets to simulating intricate phenomena, it's an indispensable part of the research lifecycle. Yet, understanding and quantifying its impact remains a significant challenge for researchers, project contributors, institutions, and funders alike.

How do we effectively measure the reach and influence of these vital tools? How can we incentivize better practices around software citation, metadata, and sustainability?

To tackle these shared ecosystem challenges head-on, [NumFOCUS‚Äôs](https://numfocus.org/) [Open Source Science Initiative](http://opensource.science/) launched the 2025 ‚ÄúImpact of Research Software‚Äù Open Innovation Sprint!

Running from March through late 2025, this sprint is a collaborative, fast-paced initiative bringing together researchers, engineers, designers, community organizers, and users. Our goal is to produce actionable, community-driven outputs ‚Äì open source tools ready for immediate use and contribution.

This inaugural sprint, focused on measuring research software impact, is inspired by efforts such as the [CZI 2023 Software Impact Hackathon](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/software-impact-hackathon-2023), is led by NumFOCUS‚Äôs Open Source Science Initiative, and is made possible through collaboration with the [Research Software Alliance (ReSA)](https://www.researchsoft.org/), [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) and [ecosyste.ms](http://ecosyste.ms/), and the Sprint‚Äôs contributors and their organizations.

    preamble="
To be held as part of SC25, St. Louis, MO, USA (where US-RSE will have a dedicated booth) and online, Sunday, November 16, 2025, 8:30 am - 5:00 pm CST (UTC-6)

**=== Overview ===**

Research software engineers (RSEs) are critical to the impact of HPC, data science, and the larger scientific community. They have existed for decades, though often not under that name. The past several years, however, have seen the development of the RSE concept, common job titles, and career paths; the creation of professional networks to connect RSEs; and the emergence of RSE groups at universities, national laboratories, and industry.
This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders. We'll hear about successes and challenges that RSEs and RSE groups have experienced, and discuss ways to increase awareness of RSE opportunities and improve support for RSEs.

The workshop will be highly interactive, featuring breakout discussions and panels, as well as invited addresses and submitted talks.
