# **Steering Committee Elections**

Our first formal elections for 4 seats on the steering committee were held in December. Congratulations to the newly elected steering committee members: Julia Damerow, Chris Hill, Daniel S. Katz, and Lance Parsons. A special thank you to all the candidates and everyone who voted.

# **First Annual General Meeting**

We held our first US-RSE [Annual General Meeting (AGM)](https://us-rse.org/events/2020/2020-12-AGM) on December 4th, 2020. It included an update on US-RSE happenings along with statements from the steering committee candidates. If you missed it, the meeting [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcl3QY1lBzY) is available on the [US-RSE YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7IQsWv809OQYJ-sJKuQZrw).

# **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group**

The US-RSE Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group (DEI WG) needs YOU!

Things we're actively working on include:

* Organizing **invited speakers** to discuss DEI initiatives and related topics
* Engaging with DEI in Technology groups such as **[Women in HPC](https://womeninhpc.org/)** and **[Code 2040](http://www.code2040.org/)**
* Guidance on and examples of how to write **inclusive RSE job descriptions** to ensure they attract a diverse audience

If you’d like to help us out, or have ideas about other things we should be doing, please contact us on the *[#dei-discussion](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C01C8CJQ7AP)* Slack channel or contact Lance Parsons ([lparsons@princeton.edu](mailto:lparsons@princeton.edu)) and we’ll help get you involved.

# **Community Meeting on Education and Training**

We recently held our February Community Meeting on "Education and Training: How RSEs gain skills, learn the field." The discussions were lively and we think it raised momentum for building a working group on education and training. We encourage you to join the [#education-training](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C01833QUB7D) Slack channel to continue the conversation.

# **ADSA/US-RSE Career Panel**

On Thursday, February 23rd we are teaming up with the [Academic Data Science Alliance](https://academicdatascience.org/) to host an [Early Career Panel: "What do data scientists and research software engineers do in academia?“](https://academicdatascience.org/cdn/early-career-panel) This career panel will offer attendees the opportunity to hear from data scientists and research software engineers about their career paths, the skills expected of these positions, where and how to seek these types of positions, and what to expect when working in these fields. This event will focus on students, postdocs, and those early in their careers, but all are welcome to attend. Please pass along the [registration link](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIkc-irqj8tG9ZWgUSZZ51BwuZEK_QO_e1i) to anyone who may be interested.
