# **Steering Committee Elections**
    
Thank you to the nine excellent [candidates](https://us-rse.org/2022-11-18-sc-candidates/) who shared their vision for the US-RSE Association's future and the 135 US-RSE members who voted in the 2022 Steering Committee election.  The four candidates elected to a two-year term starting January 2023 are:

* Julia Damerow
* Rinku Gupta
* Kenton McHenry
* Miranda Mundt

We're excited to welcome three new members to the [Steering Committee](https://us-rse.org/about/steering-committee/) and to have Julia back for two more years. 

Thanks to our other excellent candidates Keith Beattie, Aaron Holmes, Lauren Milechin, Lance Parsons, and Joshua Teves for making the election a success. All of them have helped to grow US-RSE and make it successful. We look forward to their continued contributions.

We extend a special thank you to Lance Parsons who was a founding member of the Steering Committee and has volunteered hundreds of hours over the past four years creating US-RSE. We especially want to acknowledge his continuing work with the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion working group and the Code of Conduct review effort.

We also want to thank two outgoing Steering Committee members who did not participate in the election, Daniel Katz and Chris Hill. Both are founding members of the US-RSE Association and US-RSE Steering Committee. They brought decades of experience to establish US-RSE, connect it to the broader research software community, and set US-RSE up for a bright future. Both Dan and Chris are still leading various community activities and initiatives, so we can expect to continue to benefit from their experience and leadership.

# **Steering Committee Recap**

In November and December, the Steering Committee has been discussing moving to a new fiscal sponsor that will be able to better support our future financial sustainability.  The Steering Committee voted to apply to a new sponsor.
    
The Steering Committee has also continued planning for the 2023 US-RSE Conference, including choosing chairs for the conference planning committees, discussing what benefits are appropriate to offer to conference sponsors, and reviewing costs.
    
Discussions about securing funding for a community manager, executive director, organizational infrastructure, outreach efforts, and the US-RSE conference also continue, with a focus on refining a budget and the details of what paid positions would do for US-RSE.

_Stay tuned for more talks in the coming months, with talks from NIH and CZI expected!_

## US-RSE DEI-WG Speaker Series

The US-RSE Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group (DEI-WG) is working to bring to the US-RSE community quarterly visits from RSE professionals with vested interests or research into DEI in the RSE community at large. Our community pledges to continually educate ourselves through research on best practices focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The US-RSE is committed to providing an inclusive environment with equitable treatment for all and to promoting and encouraging diversity throughout the RSE community. We encourage everyone to suggest speakers and topics and are open to different formats and timelines of the events. Feedback is much appreciated.

# **Interesting Events and Opportunities**


## RDA's 10th Anniversary Events and Activities
    
In 2023 the Research Data Alliance is celebrating its [10th Anniversary: ‘A Decade of Data’](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries-events/events/%E2%80%98-decade-data%E2%80%99-celebrating-10-years-research-data-alliance). They are commemorating this important milestone with the community by organising a series of international, regional events and activities. Each month of 2023, from February to November, will be dedicated to a [specific theme](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries-events/events/%E2%80%98-decade-data%E2%80%99-celebrating-10-years-rda/rdas-10th-anniversary-events-and) related to research data management of relevance to the RDA community. February's theme will be FAIR data, hardware, and software and includes a podcast on February 6 on the FAIR for Virtual Research Environments (VRE) Working Group. Registration for the events are free but required for webinars.
    
    
## Funding Opportunity from Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for Open Source Software ##
    
The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation opened a [Call for Letters of Inquiry: Institutional Support for Open Source Software in Research](https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/ospo-loi) due February 15, 2023.

The Technology program at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation supports research, training, community-building, and technological innovation in order to foster advances in the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. The program is currently soliciting Letters of Inquiry from Principal Investigators at U.S. research institutions to launch Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). A small number of full proposals will be invited from submissions received in response to this Call. Grant amounts are expected to be up to $750,000 over a two-year period. Successful Letters of Inquiry will offer a clear vision for a long-term institutional support ecosystem for open source software - and the university faculty, students, research software engineers, and staff who build and maintain it - beyond the funding period.
