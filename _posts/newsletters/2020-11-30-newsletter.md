# **First Annual General Meeting**

We will hold our first US-RSE [Annual General Meeting (AGM)](https://us-rse.org/events/2020/2020-12-AGM) on December 4th, 2020, 1-3pm ET, for all our members. This will be an opportunity to hear from US-RSE leadership about events in 2020 and future plans for the Association. Candidates running for the US-RSE Steering Committee will be given an opportunity to introduce themselves. Questions or discussion topics should be submitted ahead of time via this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfr2A9vLDGjuCj5CtnSla0fz8nkQut9H0s4Yu62C3pHVecu1Q/viewform?usp=sf_link). Prior [registration](https://princeton.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJErcuyrqj8rE9aUl9RwE4Y_-QetlSLK2BVj) is required and must match the email address on file with US-RSE. All members are invited and encouraged to attend, and the meeting will be recorded and made available shortly afterwards for those who can't make it.

# **Meet the Steering Committee Candidates**

As [shared](https://us-rse.org/2020-06-29-sc-transition/) this summer, we're holding an election for four seats on the Steering Committee in December. Read about the candidates on the [website](https://us-rse.org/2020-11-23-sc-candidates/) and hear from them during the [AGM](https://us-rse.org/events/2020/2020-12-AGM), and ask any questions you might have for them on the [#election](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C01BC66Q16E) channel on Slack.  You'll be asked to rank order the six candidates for the steering committee during the election, which runs December 13-19.  Good luck to all of the candidates, and thank you for volunteering!

# **US-RSE Community Call on DEI**

The October Community Call covered the topic "Diversity, Equity and Inclusion" or DEI.  The goal of the call was to have an open discussion about steps US-RSE might take in promoting diversity within the US-RSE organization and externally in our profession. A blog post summarizing the call can be found [here](https://us-rse.org/2020-10-13-community-call-dei/). As a result of the call, a new DEI working group was formed along with a slack channel, [#dei-discussion](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C01C8CJQ7AP), for related discussions. The DEI working group has met once since the original community call and is now scheduling a second meeting. All are welcome to join. Because of the [AGM](https://us-rse.org/events/2020/2020-12-AGM) in December, the next community call will take place in January. Those interested in proposing a topic for any of the future community calls should do so in the [#communitycalls](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/CLBDQMJH5) Slack channel.

# **The 2nd International Leaders Workshop**

The [2nd International Leaders Workshop](https://researchsoftware.org/2020-workshop.html) took place in September and attracted 39 participants from 13 countries on five continents, and included delegates from eight national or multinational RSE associations: [*de-RSE*](https://de-rse.org/en/), [*Society of RSE (UK)*](https://society-rse.org/), [*NL-RSE*](https://nl-rse.org/), [*US-RSE*](https://us-rse.org/), [*Nordic RSE*](https://nordic-rse.org/), [*African RSSE*](https://rsse-africa.sanbi.ac.za/login), [*beRSE*](https://www.be-rse.org/), and [*AUS/NZ RSE*](https://rse-aunz.github.io/). Even though they do not have formal RSE associations, individuals from Argentina, Colombia, France, Canada, and Spain also joined the workshop.  It was thrilling to see such broadly international attendance and we are looking forward to more international collaboration! You can find more information about the workshop in the blog posts linked below in [Interesting Reads](#reads).

# **RSE at SC20**

We were excited to hold the inaugural Research Software Engineers in HPC Workshop (RSE-HPC-2020) as part of the SC20 conference this year!  The half-day, virtual event featured 18 speakers and had over 100 participants. Keynote addresses were given by RSE leaders from the UK and Germany on the history of the RSE movements in their countries.  The event also featured three lightning talks, and two panel discussions on the topics "Building RSE Teams and Groups" and “Supporting RSE Careers.”  We were glad to see the high level of interest in the talks and discussions, and we look forward to holding more of these workshops in the future.

In addition to the RSE workshop, RSEs from the US and elsewhere led and participated in several other SC20 events.  The HPC community is giving increasing attention to the research software they run and the people who write it; this was evident in these events, and we hope to see the trend continue.
