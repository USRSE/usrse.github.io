# **US-RSE Community Calls**

The April community call will be on April 14, 2022 at 12 ET. Our plan for April is a slightly different format. Following the request in https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues/12 we are looking for people interested in giving a short talk on a new technology or tool you would be interested to tell others about. This could be something from your own project or some new technology you are learning from elsewhere. Depending on interest these might be lightning 5 minute talks or longer talks with time for discussion! If you are interested reach out to either Julia Damerow or Chris Hill or ping us on the Community Call slack channel. 

You can find the recordings of our monthly calls [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLMgG8jy8w-8neP6gPOgifH6kh4t_RUTTH). We are also discussing finding a new time for the community call to make the time work better for our members in Hawaii and Alaska. Stay tuned!

Interested in suggesting a topic or leading a community call?  We meet two weeks prior to each community call to decide on a topic and discuss how to structure the call. Anyone is welcome to join the preparation call on [Zoom](https://mit.zoom.us/j/93471607274?pwd=aXUzNzZsWElpWnc4N2NXaWxOcVNlQT09).

# **Community News**

* **The Research Software Engineers in HPC Workshop (RSE-HPC-2022) was accepted by SC22**. 
More information will follow soon! 
* **Participants Needed for Mentorship Study**
A team of software engineering researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology and Sandia National Laboratories are requesting participants to complete a short survey for their study on the role of mentorship for personal and professional development in software developers. [You can access the survey here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJ8pXrfzQaJQ2uXQX3cv3lLAlCm0h5n2YhWl-2Wq2BN66nWQ/viewform)!

* **Bennett Wineholt is Seeking Public Climate Change AI Applications Ready to Scale**
Over the next few months he will be developing [public workshop materials](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/topics) with the Cornell CAC  for GPU cluster usage on large US NSF XSEDE resources. They would like to survey impactful climate application users to make sure their needs will be covered. He would appreciate any leads on research contacts for sample applications that are ready to run and can expect to highly utilize around 8-200 Nvidia V100 GPUs. Please see [this link](https://community.climatechange.ai/c/grants-finding-collaborators/seeking-public-ccai-applications-ready-to-scale) for further details, they look forward to helping scale up climate impact!

* **The Code Review Working Group of [DHTech](https://dh-tech.github.io/) is starting the alpha phase of implementing a code review process for the digital humanities**. For the initial round of reviews, we are looking for people willing to submit code for review and people willing to review someone else’s code. If you are willing to participate, we will also ask you to complete a feedback questionnaire at the end to help us improve the process.
If you would like to have your code reviewed, please fill out the [code review request form](https://forms.gle/DKmsBSNsUY35nr6x9). Your code should be available on GitHub. It should take less than an hour to review. For more information about the conditions your code should meet, please review our [review preparation instructions](https://github.com/DHCodeReview/DHCodeReview/wiki/Authors:-Preparing-a-Code-Review).
If you are interested in being a reviewer, please fill out the [reviewer application form](https://forms.gle/PepxF6U64AT2Y5TZA). We expect reviews to take no more than an hour to complete.
If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with us either by joining the #code-review-wg channel on the [DHTech Slack](https://dh-tech.github.io/join/) or by emailing Julia Damerow ([jdamerow@asu.edu](mailto:jdamerow@asu.edu)).

# **Two new groups forming**

* We are looking for volunteers to lead planning for a potential US-RSE 2023 conference. We will be posting on Slack too, but if you are interested, please reach out to any or all of Sandra Gesing, Chris Hill, and Dan Katz. The format and scope for the conference are all open, so if you have ideas and thoughts it would be great to have you involved. 

* We are starting a new financial sustainability working group. The goal of this group will be to examine and develop a range of ideas to move US-RSE to a stable financial model. Please feel free to reach out to Chris Hill if you are interested in participating in this working group. The group will meet at least monthly and will look at everything from sponsorship, individual and institutional membership models, more logo items, philanthropic partners and beyond! 

<a name="financials"></a>
# **See how we are doing financially**

We organize US-RSE financials transparently via the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/usrse) project. You can see all budgets, expenses, and contributions on [this site](https://opencollective.com/usrse). Anyone can go to the site and see the current accounts, income and expenses and ….. (if the mood takes you and you are able) **[make a tax-deductible gift to US-RSE](https://opencollective.com/usrse#category-CONTRIBUTE)**!

<a name="involved"></a>
# **Get Involved**

There are lots of ways to get involved with the US-RSE community. Of course, you can [join us on Slack](https://us-rse.org/join) or volunteer for an interview with the RSE Stories podcast. But we’re also looking for ideas and help in many other places. See our [list of projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjVD0WkeeWZJI6yqSKyMdIjtClzolsxv75RkpLju17I/edit?usp=sharing) and let us know how you’d like to help. Help with things like the Website Committee, Social Media, Community Engagement, Fundraising and Newsletter are all needed and welcome.

As always we thank everyone who is already contributing for their help in shaping and growing the organization. In 2021 we added nearly 300 new members. There are still many more RSEs and friends of RSEs we would like to help connect and support. If you are interested in helping in any way please feel free to join in.
