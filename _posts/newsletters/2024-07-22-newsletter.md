# **1. Membership Benefits**  

The US-RSE leadership team (Executive Director, Community Manager, and Steering Committee) has been strategizing about how to bring additional membership benefits to you, our valued members. We are excited to bring a new benefit, one that we hope is the first of many new tangible benefits for US-RSE members!

We’ve negotiated/partnered with the [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/) to bring discounted rates to their upcoming conference. Agile Alliance is a global non-profit membership organization founded on the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/). They support people and organizations who explore, apply and expand Agile values, principles, and practices. There is some clear overlap with US-RSE with goals in regard to agile development and material that can benefit people in agile software development and/or agile management.

Agile Alliance has their [Agile 2024 conference](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile2024/) from July 22-26th, 2024 at the Gaylord Texan. As US-RSE member you can get **$200** off the registration fee with this code specifically for US-RSE **AA21US-RSE**!

Do you have suggestions for other organizations that could be potential US-RSE partners? Or other member benefits that you’d like to see? If so email [sandra@us-rse.org](mailto:sandra@us-rse.org).

### **Member Spotlight - Jamil Gafur** 

![Jamil Gafur]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/jamil_gafur.png "Jamil Gafur")


**Background**

Hi! My name is Jamil.

As a first-generation Guyanese student from New York, my undergraduate journey illuminated the transformative potential of computer science across diverse disciplines. My initial experience in software development for domain scientists occurred in my third year of undergrad, where I integrated computational methods into their work. This opportunity revealed how my contributions could positively impact various domains. Subsequently, I expanded my experiences to prestigious institutions such as Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) and the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) before embarking on a doctoral program here at the University of Iowa.

Throughout my works, I have always collaborated closely with domain scientists. This was unknowingly my first step as a Research Software Engineer (RSE) and I eventually found the United States Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE) in my first year of my Ph.D. Upon finding the US-RSE Association, my experience deepened my commitment to empowering scientists by enabling them to implement robust software solutions, thereby enhancing the reproducibility and impact of their research.


**Research Software Engineering**

My journey as an RSE began during my bachelor's degree when I worked as a Research Assistant in a biochemistry lab. This experience introduced me to the world of research that impacts society positively, which fascinated me. Subsequently, I secured an internship at LANL, where I was exposed to diverse RSE opportunities like parallel computing for epidemiology, parameter optimization for material simulations, and software design for atmospheric modeling. 

Discovering this field was a revelation; I found immense enjoyment in the work and was surprised that I could be paid to teach, conduct research, travel, and make a meaningful impact. During my program, I have deepened my understanding of the RSE field and also started mentoring others on the side. Collaborating with like-minded individuals and nurturing the next generation of RSEs has been immensely fulfilling.


**US-RSE Involvement**

The Education and Training Working Group's seminars and the training materials on the US-RSE website have been invaluable resources for me. I take pride in contributing to the compilation of training resources featured on the site, which are designed for self-paced learning and offer members opportunities to acquire various skills.

Another aspect of the US-RSE community that I particularly enjoy is the memes channel I introduced on our Slack platform. This channel has been a lighthearted yet effective way to foster camaraderie and build a sense of community among members. Beyond sharing funny and relatable content, it has helped us connect on a more personal level, enhancing our overall experience as part of the US-RSE network. Building this community through humor has been a refreshing and positive contribution to our journey in the RSE field together.
