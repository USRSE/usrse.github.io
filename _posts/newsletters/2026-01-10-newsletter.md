### Executive Director's Interview on NAIRR Pilot

The NAIRR pilot, supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) & SGX3, has evolved from concept to a real 
shared AI research platform that connects researchers, educators, industry partners, and national labs. Our 
Executive Director, Sandra Gesing, highlights how this 2-year-old collaborative infrastructure is lowering barriers 
for teams that once couldn’t access powerful computing, tools, and expertise to fuel creativity, discovery, and 
possibility.

### Social Media Coordinator's Presentation at iPRES2025

> At iPRES 2025 in Wellington, I shared how many library and archive developers are already doing RSE work even if it’s not called “RSEng”, supported by the US-RSE travel funds. I reflect on why US-RSE should welcome these preservation-minded professionals and how our connection with the National Library of New Zealand is building a bridge across communities.

Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, & US-RSE Social Media Coordinator

### Impact of US-RSE Community and Travel Funds on Data Carpentries

Building on the success of last year’s first Data Carpentry workshop to ever be offered in Israel, generous funding from the US-RSE Community and Travel Funds enabled the success of a [Data Carpentry Metagenomics workshop](https://carpentries-lab.github.io/metagenomics-workshop/) in October 2025, at Tel Aviv University in Israel. The two-day, hands-on workshop was made possible by a partnership among the US-RSE, the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), the [Israel Research Core Facilities](https://www.israel-cores.org/), the [George Washington University Libraries](http://library.gwu.edu/), [Tel Aviv University](https://english.tau.ac.il/), [Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS)](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/) and [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/).

A key goal of the workshop was to empower local instructors to take on more of the teaching responsibilities. In addition to last year’s instructors Dan Kerchner, a Senior Software Developer and Bioinformatics PhD student from George Washington University in Washington, DC and Dr. Dan Ben-Avraham, head of Israel’s ELIXIR node and head of the WIS Mantoux Institute for Bioinformatics, major sections covering Bash shell and a metagenomics analysis pipeline were taught this year by WIS bioinformaticians Dr. Dayana Yahalomi and Dr. Amir Szitenberg, with support from Dr. Avital Sarusi-Portuguez.

The diverse group of 24 learners from 11 institutions included MS and PhD students, postdoctoral and staff researchers in the life sciences, as well as international students and postdocs from India, Brazil, and the U.S. conducting research at institutions across Israel. Hands-on learning included project data organization for metagenomics, cloud computing, Bash shell, R coding, and applying these skills to process real-world whole-genome sequencing data through a series of command-line analysis tools to determine relative proportions of different taxa of bacteria from samples taken from Cuatro Ciénegas, a unique ecological environment in Mexico. Research computing best practices were emphasized throughout. Participants reported increased skill levels, better understanding of how coding contributes to research reproducibility, higher confidence in applying their new software engineering skills to their research, and a desire for more learning opportunities of this type. We look forward to building on the success of the US-RSE-sponsored workshop and the enthusiasm for more workshops of this type in Israel to further develop RSE skills, connections, and community.

MIRA is a Navigation Fund supported production-focused workshop convening 22 researchers, engineers, designers, and ecosystem specialists to develop and implement interoperable standards for modular research attribution across participating platforms.

    title="2026 Summer Internships in Parallel Computational Science (SIParCS) Applications Now Open!" 
    preamble="
We are pleased to announce that we are now accepting applications for the 2026 Summer Internships in Parallel Computational Science (SIParCS). The application deadline for the 2026 SIParCS program is January 20, 2026 at 5 PM Mountain Time.
This year we are offering undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to work with technical projects ranging in topics from machine learning, data science, software engineering, data assimilation, digital asset management, and application optimization/parallelization in HPC among others. If you're interested in applying, please visit our website to review our technical statements of work and apply to up to two projects you would like to work with. Learn more about NSF NCAR as a science organization for a resilient, sustainable society.
We also have a CISL Outreach, Development, and Education (CODE) Intern, for graduate students in Higher Education Administration / Student Affairs, Science Education, Education Policy, Social Work, or related programs who are interested in learning about HPC Education and Outreach."

GOOD26 is a four-day in-person gathering taking place from March 9-12, 2026 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Attendees will have the opportunity to participate in live keynote sessions, talks, BoFs, and tutorials that share insights and best practices, explore new features, and strengthen the Open OnDemand community.
As with at GOOD25, the conference will kick off on Monday afternoon (March 9) with the optional Contributor Jam, an intensive deep dive into our code and documentation which will prepare attendees to contribute back to the Open OnDemand open source project."

    title="Please, No More Loops (Than Necessary): New Patterns in Fortran 2023" 
    when="January 21, 2026, 1pm – 2pm EDT" 
    where="Online"
    preamble="Loops are seemingly ubiquitous in programming and yet writing loops provides one example of a common practice stuck in a pattern as old as high-level programming languages themselves. This webinar will provide an overview of the features introduced in Fortran standards from Fortran 90 to 2023. We will venture into often-unvisited nooks and crannies and traverse equally unvisited expansive pastures. Weaving feature groups together by the approaches they enable, the talk will emphasize array, object-oriented, parallel, modular, and functional programming patterns and paradigms. The talk will demonstrate the utility of the described features in open-source packages developed by Berkeley Lab’s Computer Languages and System Software (CLaSS) Group and our collaborators. The presentation will emphasize expressiveness and conciseness, showing how our Julienne correctness-checking framework supports writing assertions and unit tests using natural-language idioms; how we write textbook-form partial differential equations (PDE) in the Matcha T-cell motility simulator; and how we concisely capture advanced algorithms for training neural networks in the Fiats deep learning library. The talk will include a brief update on the status of the compiler and runtime-library support for these features in the open-source LLVM flang compiler and the Caffeine parallel runtime library developed by CLaSS and our collaborators. The talk will conclude with a description of the planned Fortran 2028 support for generic programming via type-safe templates and the powerful ramifications of this technology in our development a formally verifiable, domain-specific language embedded in Fortran 2028 via a type system being developed for the MOLE PDE solver library. One recurring theme will be the ability to write thousands of lines of code manipulating large collections of data with few or no loops."
