# **First US-RSE Conference in 2023 in Chicago**
We are excited to organize the first US-RSE Conference, October 16-18, 2023 at the University of Illinois, Chicago! We are looking for volunteers for the organizing committee. We see this as a chance to make it a community-driven event where community members can build the program. We have several chair positions available, and we aim to have a chair and a co-chair for each role. We would also like to encourage people who do not have experience  in organizing conferences to apply for a position, and we will pair them with a more experienced chair. This is an opportunity for you to build and demonstrate leadership skills and have deep involvement in community engagement. Please take under consideration that it is a commitment of about a year with biweekly meetings at the beginning, moving to weekly meetings starting in April 2023 and additionally the actual tasks for the conference dependent on your chair role.
Please fill out this form if you are interested.

# **RSE-HPC-2022 Workshop at SC22**

We are excited to announce the Research Software Engineers in HPC Workshop (RSE-HPC-2022) to be held as part of [SC22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/) (hybrid event, in Dallas, TX and virtually). This will be a half-day workshop 1:30pm-5:00pm CST (UTC-6), Sunday, November 13, 2022.

This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders.  We’ll discuss the current activities and plans of national RSE organizations, discuss the needs of RSEs and RSE groups, and brainstorm ways RSE organizations can help address these.

Participation is open to all SC22 attendees who have registered to attend the conference workshops.
    
For more information, see the [workshop website](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2022/) or [contact the organizers](mailto:sc-ws-rse-hpc@info.supercomputing.org).

<a name="scbooth"></a>
# **US-RSE SC22 Booth**
For the first time ever US-RSE will have an exhibitor booth at [SC22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/)!
We’ll be spreading the good word about RSEs and staffing the booth with friendly faces looking to give away some US-RSE swag (stickers, pens, etc.) and other promotional material.
So if you’ll be at SC22, come stop by [booth 4201](https://hallerickson.ungerboeck.com/prod/app85.cshtml?AppCode=VFP&OrgCode=34&EvtID=5025&CC=SC22SM). 
And if you’d like join in the conversation or help with the booth head over to slack channel [#sc22](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C03107HT6G4).

# **ADSA/US-RSE Career Support Workshop**
The Academic Data Science Alliance (ADSA) and US-RSE hosted a [workshop](https://academicdatascience.org/adsa-meetings/2022-fall-workshop) to create resources to help academic institutions and those who hire and manage staff data scientists and RSEs support their careers - from recruitment to professional development and retention. The workshop took place on October 24-25, 2022 in Chicago. Participants spent two days developing the initial draft of a handbook that addresses how data scientists, research software engineers, hiring managers, and administrators can successfully create rewarding career paths for these new types of positions. Work continues and the goal is to publish a version of the handbook in 2023, after which it will become a living document open for additional input and community contirbutions. 
    
    
<a name ="jobarchive"></a>
# **Help Create an RSE Job Description Archive**
    
Following the recent [ADSA/US-RSE Academic Data Scientist/RSE Career Support Workshop](https://academicdatascience.org/adsa-meetings/2022-fall-workshop) that is writing a handbook on hiring and supporting DSs/RSEs at academic institutions, we would like to archive the full postings for jobs listed on the [US-RSE Job Board](https://us-rse.org/jobs/) on a regular basis.  This archive would help people writing job descriptions for their own institutions, and it could also help applicants to see the range of RSE positions available.  If you think you could set up an automated system to periodically collect the original full postings from company/university sites and archive them, please get in touch with Christina Maimone via [email](mailto:christina.maimone@northwestern.edu) or on Slack.

<a name="sc-update"></a>
# **Steering Committee Recap**

Since August, the Steering Committee has been discussing and working on the following topics:

 * The first US-RSE Conference in October 2023: more details in this newsletter
 * What funding US-RSE needs to grow as a community and what paid positions US-RSE needs to be successful, such as a Community Manager

<a name="funder-talks"></a>
# **Funders Conversation Series**

A subgroup of the US-RSE Outreach Working Group is organizing a Funder Series, a speaker series aimed at bringing representatives from funders (e.g., DOE, Sloan, NSF, NIH) to speak to members of US-RSE. These funders will bring essential information about opportunities, strategies, and starting points for finding funding.

The first talk, which went well and received very good feedback, was from Hal Finkel from DOE on October 27th, and we'll soon be adding his slides and a recording to [this part of the Outreach WG webpage](https://us-rse.org/wg/outreach/). Future talks will happen on a roughly 6-8 week cadence, so the next one should be in early December. If you have feedback on the first event or suggestions for future speakers, please let [Dan](mailto:d.katz@ieee.org) know.

# **Elevating RSEs Working Group**

Many of us have similar stories in regards to recognizing the criticality of our roles in supporting modern research endeavors, yet struggle to gain the recognition of that amongst campus leadership, which oftentimes still thinks in terms of more traditional university roles such as faculty and students.  The aim of the Elevating RSEs working group is to help all of us make this clearer at our various organizations.  A key aspect of this is making it very clear to researchers, as well as funding agencies, the scientific discoveries that we are enabling, the scholarship that could not be done otherwise.  As a first step we are soliciting from the RSE community stories of such discoveries that were RSE enabled!  If you have such a story please fill out [this brief form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zCf4CShRvK3ec1IJasTgGi0_a568gPVRZPMlv3nmlZY).  From these stories we will be doing three things in the short term:

- highlighting one story in our newsletter each month,
- compiling a slide deck ([here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s_5EhuxKm2aJbvJ4X-Lb2BXOputs5GzZhJ4_ion2Nfg/edit#slide=id.p)) with these stories that we can pull slides from when we talk about the importance of RSEs with our colleagues, collaborators, and leadership, and
- collecting outreach channels we should aim to include for our newsletters and other outreach activities.

Longer-term plans include other activities along this front such as an RSE conference where submitted papers are peer reviewed on both the science and the RSE aspects of the effort.  If you have other ideas and are interested in being part of this working group, please join the [#wg-elevate-rse channel](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C03DW50KY80) in the USRSE slack. 


<a name="outreach"></a>
# **US-RSE Outreach**

Please join us in Dallas, Texas, after the RSEs in HPC Workshop, for our [US-RSE Social Event](https://us-rse.org/events/2022/2022-11-sc22-social/). Check the event page or Slack for details on the location!

Have you ever wondered, "Where can I find existing material (presentations, slides, videos, etc.) about the US-RSE?" The [US-RSE Outreach Materials Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gu_0fhAZt7jjrDFWTHekyRLBboCZUnc8) is a location for any US-RSE member to put content relating to RSE or US-RSE outreach! Have you done a presentation? Made a cool one-page guide? Written an article or a blog post? We encourage you to add it!


<a name="financials"></a>
# **See how we are doing financially**

We organize US-RSE financials transparently via the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/usrse) project. You can see all budgets, expenses, and contributions on [this site](https://opencollective.com/usrse). Anyone can go to the site and see the current accounts, income and expenses and ….. (if the mood takes you and you are able) **[make a tax-deductible gift to US-RSE](https://opencollective.com/usrse#category-CONTRIBUTE)**!

<a name="involved"></a>
# **Get Involved**

There are lots of ways to get involved with the US-RSE community. Of course, you can [join us on Slack](https://us-rse.org/join). We’re also looking for ideas and help in many other places. See our [list of projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjVD0WkeeWZJI6yqSKyMdIjtClzolsxv75RkpLju17I/edit?usp=sharing) and let us know how you’d like to help. Help with things like the Website Committee, Social Media, Community Engagement, Fundraising, and Newsletter are all needed and welcome.

As always we thank everyone who is already contributing for their help in shaping and growing the organization. In 2021 we added nearly 300 new members. There are still many more RSEs and friends of RSEs we would like to help connect and support. If you are interested in helping in any way please feel free to join in.
