# **Steering Committee Recap**

In March 2024, the Steering Committee worked with our Executive Director and Community Manager to examine fundraising opportunities for US-RSE, look into membership database options, and implement a new process for sending organization-wide emails. We had further discussions on some of the topics from our [strategic planning meeting](https://us-rse.org/2024-04-11-sc-planning/), including organizational memberships and options for volunteer recognition. We discussed issues related to budgeting and logistics for our upcoming US-RSE'24 conference, and we started considering locations for the US-RSE'25 conference next year.

# Upcoming Events

## Save the Dates for the 2024 FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute (FSCI) and the FORCE2024 conference

A heads-up for a unique opportunity in 2024 - the co-location of the [2024 FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute (FSCI)](https://force11.org/fsci-2024/) and the FORCE2024 conference in sunny Los Angeles.

In-person FSCI courses will be conducted on the modern UCLA campus from Monday July 29 to Wednesday July 31, followed immediately by the FORCE11 Conference from Thursday August 1 to Saturday August 3. For those not wishing to travel, there will be virtual FSCI courses running the previous week, from Monday July 22 to Friday July 26.

**FSCI2024** courses are being run on the theme: “Increasing Transparency, Integrity and Trust in Research" - with the increasing prominence of AI, it is essential that the research and scholarly communication communities emphasize transparency, enhance integrity, and renew trust in our community’s work. FSCI courses are interdisciplinary, collaborative and interactive. All courses have been chosen and we will be releasing details shortly.

The **FORCE2024** conference is rare event that reaches a number of different communities and, most importantly, people who “do”. The conference attracts attendees from startups to policy makers. This year's theme is: “Driving transformation in scholarly communications locally and globally”. Look out for our Call for Papers.

## Getting it Right: System Testing of Scientific Software

Testing software to ensure its correctness is a challenging yet critical task that can consume more than 50% of the software lifecycle. Over the past decade, software testing practices have been built into development frameworks and many are embracing the use of unit tests and continuous integration–testing as they code. However, these types of tests focus heavily on covering individual code elements and may miss important system-level requirements.

[Getting it Right: System Testing of Scientific Software](https://exascaleproject.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJItcemvpj8iG8vyauLJ4M6hukBbw4D3fxM) will discuss system testing for scientific software, present some challenges, such as configurability, and present some techniques that can be used to help improve the testing process.

# **US-RSE Financials**

From a financial perspective, 2023 was an exciting year for US-RSE. We were awarded a two-year grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and switched fiscal sponsors. We are very grateful to the Open Collective Foundation (OCF) that was our fiscal sponsor until last spring. However, with the awarded grant our needs changed and we are now a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](https://communityinitiatives.org/) (CI). CI gives us the structure and resources to hire staff such as the Executive Director and the Community Manager, accept donations and reimburse members for expenses they incurred on behalf of US-RSE. The community funds possible via the Alfred P. Sloan grant are also awarded via CI.

The majority of the grant from the Sloan Foundation is budgeted to pay for our new Executive Director and Community Manager. Besides that we've budgeted money to support staff travel, the US-RSE conference, fund community activities through our new Community and Travel Fund program, and fund smaller items such as code of conduct trainings for our code of conduct committee members. CI charges 10% of our income for providing resources, infrastructure, and support (trust us when we say we make good use of those resources). Switching from OCF to CI turned out to been an unexpectedly complex change and it has been a very steep learning curve. We appreciate our members' patience as we navigate the world of non-profit regulations and guidelines.
