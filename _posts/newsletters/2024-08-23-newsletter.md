**Next Application Deadline** September 30, 2024


## **Dagstuhl Seminar - Nasir Eisty**

**Overview of the purpose of funding**

My name is Nasir Eisty, and I’m an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Boise State University. I applied individually for the US-RSE community grant, which funded my entire travel from Boise, Idaho, to Germany and covered the registration fee for the Dagstuhl Seminar. I attended a seminar titled “Research Software Engineering: Bridging Knowledge Gaps,” held from April 14 to April 19, 2024, at Schloss Dagstuhl in Wadern, Germany. Dagstuhl Seminars are high-level, week-long meetings of leading computer science researchers, focusing on cutting-edge topics and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and intensive interaction to advance research and shape future directions in computer science.

**Overview of my experience** 

The Dagstuhl Seminar 24161, "Research Software Engineering: Bridging Knowledge Gaps," included 36 participants from academia, national labs, and research centers across various countries. The participants were divided into two groups: software engineering researchers and research software engineers, aiming to reduce knowledge gaps and foster collaboration. We formed breakout groups based on common interests, reported our outcomes in large group discussions, and participated in other collective activities. The seminar aimed to bridge the knowledge gap, as there is currently insufficient transfer of state-of-the-art research knowledge between software engineering researchers and research software engineering. This gap contributes to an incomplete understanding of domain-specific and general challenges in research software engineering. Throughout the week, each group worked together and initiated vision papers, poster presentations, vlogs, and websites, continuing their efforts to disseminate the knowledge created during the seminar.

**Benefits to RSEs/US-RSE**

In general, this interactive seminar brought together the computer science and software engineering research community with the research software engineering community to define a common language and enhance reciprocal knowledge transfer. The outcomes from the seminar will significantly impact research software engineers (RSEs) in various ways, including community formation, the application of state-of-the-art software engineering practices, and the improvement of research software quality and reliability.

This seminar also directly advanced the US-RSE mission by providing RSEs with opportunities to share knowledge, build professional connections, and access resources. It promoted the impact of RSEs on research, highlighting their increasingly critical and valuable roles throughout the seminar, where two groups were actively engaged in discussions. Participants of this Dagstuhl seminar are continuing to collaborate on producing resources that not only bridge knowledge gaps but also increase RSEs' visibility in other communities.

### **Member Spotlight - Lezlie España**

![Lezlie España]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/lezlie_member_spotlight.jpg "Lezlie España")

**Background**

Hi all! My name is Lezlie.

My ✨journey✨ to the research software engineering space has been a winding road, but we got there. I studied Computer Science and Psychology in college, was interested in neuroscience, and ended up working in my current lab during my final semester of school. Our lab does research on traumatic brain injuries, and I work specifically with neuroimaging/fMRI data that we get from studies on mild TBI and sports-related concussions. 🧠

**Research Software Engineering**

As I learned more about all of the software used in the neuroimaging space and started to work on being more efficient with my code and data processing, I started to look for other people working in similar fields. It became important for me to find community at the intersection of medical research/academia and programming. And of course that led me to US-RSE! 🎉

**US-RSE Involvement**

As part of US-RSE I've been involved in a couple behind-the-scenes projects. I hope those who have joined recently found the new member welcome/orientation helpful! That was one of my first projects as a community member. I was also involved in the revamp of our Code of Conduct and currently serve on the CoC enforcement committee.

### **💡Second Virtual Workshop on Multi-Project CI/CD**

The Multi-ProjectDevOps project was founded to establish best practices for decreasing the time needed to deploy multiple high-quality scientific software packages, particularly when the packages share common requirements. Key to these best practices are maintaining continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows. Since the managed packages share common requirements the CI/CD workflows will too. We define a multi-project CI/CD workflow as a CI/CD workflow that can be reused for multiple projects. The purpose of this workshop is to share best practices, lessons learned, and solutions for multi-project CI/CD.

Registration is free. To sign up please fill out this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6Q4g2X4DwY7MWQOSLjP0fRzs9iltZ8xhp1elesyhhuYK7Mw/viewform).
