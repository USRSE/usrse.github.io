# **1. US-RSE Conference 2024 (USRSE'24) Recap**  

The [US-RSE'24 conference](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/) exceeded all expectations! With over 270 attendees, the energy and enthusiasm were apparent. We received over 100 submissions for the different program components. The resulting [program](https://us-rse.org/usrse24/program/) offered something for everyone, including talks, workshops, and countless opportunities to connect with fellow RSEs. Highlights included insightful keynotes, engaging sponsor presentations, and hands-on tutorials covering a wide range of technical topics. The lively poster session and conference dinner provided the perfect setting for networking and knowledge sharing. This incredible event wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the organizing committee, reviewers, sponsors, presenters, and participants. Thank you to everyone who made US-RSE'24 such a success! We're excited to continue supporting the growth and development of the RSE community.

# **2. USRSE'25: Join the Planning Committee**  

USRSE'25, our third annual conference, will be held in Philadelphia in October 2025.  We need your help to make it successful.  Learn more about the [Planning Committee](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/about/organization/) on the [conference website](https://us-rse.org/usrse25) and volunteer by the end of November.  We need both people experienced with conference/event planning and those looking to learn, so that we can build experience within our community for the future.

Getting involved with the planning committee will ensure you know people at USRSE'25, connect you with other RSEs and RSE allies from around the country, and give you an opportunity to use skills that you might not get to exercise every day.

* Impact of AI on Software Engineering

### **üí°Second Virtual Workshop on Multi-Project CI/CD**

The Multi-ProjectDevOps project was founded to establish best practices for decreasing the time needed to deploy multiple high-quality scientific software packages, particularly when the packages share common requirements. Key to these best practices are maintaining continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows. Since the managed packages share common requirements the CI/CD workflows will too. We define a multi-project CI/CD workflow as a CI/CD workflow that can be reused for multiple projects. The purpose of this workshop is to share best practices, lessons learned, and solutions for multi-project CI/CD.

Registration is free. To sign up please fill out this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6Q4g2X4DwY7MWQOSLjP0fRzs9iltZ8xhp1elesyhhuYK7Mw/viewform).


### **üí°Open Source Software for Fusion Energy (OSSFE) Conference**

The [Open Source Software for Fusion Energy (OSSFE) Conference](https://ossfe.github.io/) is a first-of-its-kind event dedicated to the development, use, and advancement of open-source software in the fusion energy community. Whether you're an experienced researcher, developer, or new to the field, OSSFE offers a collaborative platform to share insights, tools, and innovations that push the boundaries of fusion energy research.

# **9. Steering Committee Update**

Our main focus in October was finalizing details and supporting the conference organizing committee for this year's annual US-RSE conference, as well as announcing the USRSE'25 conference, which will take place in Philadelphia, PA. We heard updates from our Executive Director on the status of the [Organizational Membership](https://us-rse.org/org-membership/) program and her progress with our fundraising consulting firm. We also started planning the US-RSE Annual General Meeting for December and worked out logistics following the departure of our Community Manager. Finally, most of the Steering Committee attended the annual conference, which was a great chance for us to meet up and talk in person!

# **10. Get Involved**

Volunteering with US-RSE is a great way to build your professional network and gain skills that can help you take the next step in your career.  A great way to start is by joining a working group.  Reach out to contact@us-rse.org or ask on Slack if you have questions about getting started.  

New guidance was recently released on how to create new [Affinity Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-an-affinity-group) and [Working Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-a-working-group). If you see an unmet need in the US-RSE community, we encourage you to create your own group!

As always, we thank everyone who is already contributing for their help in shaping and growing the organization.
