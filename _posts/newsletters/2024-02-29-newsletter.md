# **Two-year Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Grant**

The [generous grant](https://us-rse.org/2023-04-27-sloan-grant-initiatives/) by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation  will provide support in three important areas: the recruitment of dedicated staff, the development of activities and initiatives, and the enhancement of organizational tools and community well-being. 

* A large part of US-RSE’s success has been due to the dedication and hard work of volunteers. While we don’t want to see the community-driven nature change, we recognize that relying on pure volunteer effort is limiting. For this reason the two new staff positions of a full-time Community Manager and a part-time Executive Director were created. We are excited that Sophia Anyatonwu started on December 11, 2023 as our Community Manager and Sandra Gesing started on November 1, 2023 as our Executive Director.
* Three main activities and initiatives will be funded through the grant: The US-RSE Annual Conference, a Community Funds Program, and an Awards Program.
* Developing and maintaining a vibrant and functional community network requires infrastructure. To alleviate the struggles of the current process, we’ll invest in infrastructure for managing contact information for those in the network, facilitating networking opportunities between members, allowing people to choose their level of involvement in network activities, and communicating with members. 

## Community and Travel Funds program

Part of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant for US-RSE has been delegated for the [Community and Travel Funds program](https://us-rse.org/funds-and-awards/). Members of US-RSE can apply for funds for community or individual purposes for event costs, get-togethers, travel funding, and more. Visit the webpage above for more details.

### Community and Travel Funds Recipients – December 2023

We are pleased to announce that the Community and Travel Funds Committee will fund two applications from the December 2023 deadline!

- Daniel S. Katz will be traveling to [deRSE 2024](https://events.hifis.net/event/994/) to present his talk titled “US-RSE: Today's successes and tomorrow's challenges.” He is acting as a US-RSE representative and will focus on building connections with the international RSE community.

## RSE Empowerment in National Labs

### Community building in your organization guide

Members of the US-RSE National Labs working group  recently teamed up to write an article called, ["Getting Started with the RSE Movement within your Organization: A Guide for Individuals"](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10436166).

This guide is all about helping folks who want to jump into the RSE movement within their own organizations. We've added some practical steps and tips to help you make a difference by bringing RSEs together and building a strong community. Hopefully, the community will find it useful!

### Working group participation in upcoming conferences

A number of working group members will be participating in conferences this coming April in which they'll be sharing the experience of being an RSE working in national labs. These include a panel discussion at [Sandia National Laboratories Sustainable Scientific Software Conference (S3C)](https://s3c.sandia.gov/), and presentations at the [UCAR Improving Scientific Software Conference (ISS)](https://sea.ucar.edu/conference/2024) and the [Salishan Conference on High Speed Computing](https://salishan.ahsc-nm.org/).

### Survey of members working at U.S. government research institutions

In an effort to better convey the sentiments of US-RSE members working at national labs at the above conferences, the working group is crafting a [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZRnLHWvxnX-Bxd8wJj-HXZXrFAXrcbVdu36P44MhsWUYBRA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to garner insight into the issues that members are currently facing. This survey, along with follow-up focus group discussions to be held in March, will help the presenters illustrate the challenges and needs of US-RSE members to a wider audience. Please note that the working group takes an inclusive approach to the [definition of "national lab"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b1qDN5MkNHLSeohcLmPkVjw13npcRrG88Nlq2TKEs_k/edit?usp=sharing) and as such, we encourage as many US-RSE members who work for U.S. government research institutions to please fill out the survey. The survey will open on Monday March 4, 2024 and can be accessed through [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZRnLHWvxnX-Bxd8wJj-HXZXrFAXrcbVdu36P44MhsWUYBRA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

# **US-RSE Financials**

From a financial perspective, 2023 was an exciting year for US-RSE. We were awarded a two-year grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and switched fiscal sponsors. We are very grateful to the Open Collective Foundation (OCF) that was our fiscal sponsor until last spring. However, with the awarded grant our needs changed and we are now a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](https://communityinitiatives.org/) (CI). CI gives us the structure and resources to hire staff such as the Executive Director and the Community Manager, accept donations and reimburse members for expenses they incurred on behalf of US-RSE. The community funds possible via the Alfred P. Sloan grant are also awarded via CI.

The majority of the grant from the Sloan Foundation is budgeted to pay for our new Executive Director and Community Manager. Besides that we've budgeted money to support staff travel, the US-RSE conference, fund community activities through our new Community and Travel Fund program, and fund smaller items such as code of conduct trainings for our code of conduct committee members. CI charges 10% of our income for providing resources, infrastructure, and support (trust us when we say we make good use of those resources). Switching from OCF to CI turned out to been an unexpectedly complex change and it has been a very steep learning curve. We appreciate our members' patience as we navigate the world of non-profit regulations and guidelines.
