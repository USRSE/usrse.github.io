### **Member Spotlight - Josh Teves** 

![Josh Teves]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/josh_member_spotlight.png "Josh Teves")

**Background**

Hi! My name is Josh.

My career in research software engineering started by total accident. In college, while pursuing a Bachelor's degree in physics, I did research with an atmospheric physicist. We used instruments in the field to measure raindrop sizes, but the software that these instruments came with was terrible. For example, the field site frequently lost power and, due to the bad software, when the instrument rebooted it would not correctly synchronize the clock. We needed to get some analysis software to look through and figure out when that would happen so that we would know where to truncate data that would eventually be analyzed and used to make scientific inferences. I spent a lot of time doing this and I really liked it. I liked it so much that I decided to start a PhD program. Unfortunately, I hated doing the PhD so I left my program and began looking for relevant jobs. 

**Research Software Engineering**

My wife was also looking for jobs and came across a posting where they needed someone who had experience with MATLAB. She encouraged  me to apply for the position since I had prior experience with it. I applied for the position and got my first research software engineering role helping to improve software. The project I worked on eventually led to a future role at the NIH where I had the opportunity to do even more of what I loved. This included working on challenging intellectual projects and building solutions to complex problems. I appreciate being able to go beyond data gathering to build comprehensive products for people to use. 

In 2021, I officially heard about the Research Software Engineering field through a colleague and ended up joining the US-RSE Outreach Working Group. Currently, I am a jack of all trades and R&D Computer Scientist at Sandia National Labs.

**US-RSE Involvement**

A past project that I enjoyed working on as a member of US-RSE is an article that I helped write in 2022 about RSEs at national labs. The article was for the Computing in Science and Engineering Special Edition. My colleague, Miranda Mundt, suggested that we write an article as a group. It was ultimately a great experience to see people at other national labs, learn about the differences between labs and universities, and consider how the impact is different. The group was coordinated well and we also received good reviews and feedback on the article.

### **Launch of Pilot Recognition Program** 

In an effort to foster and support a spirit of appreciation within our community, we are exploring different ways to recognize members! The Community Manager's Slack Activity Recognition Pilot Program acknowledges members who are active in various ways in our Slack community. Data was pulled in February 2024 and [various criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fairx6jETzoEjQJFlGBL18xqfjeku27lFSWN4gWRuwQ/edit) were applied in order to generate a final list of awardees. Awardees were notified in June and asked to fill out a form with their preferred contact information as well as preferences for swag.  These individuals will be receiving a recognition package within the next 1-2 months. As community manager, I‚Äôm happy and proud to be part of such a vibrant community. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to [reach out to me](mailto:sophia@us-rse.org) with any suggestions and topics!
