## **2024 HDF5 User Group Meeting (HUG) ‚Äì The HDF Group**

**Summary**

We extend our heartfelt thanks to the US Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE) for their generous support with enabling 20 students and early career professionals to attend the [2024 HDF5 User Group Meeting (HUG)](https://www.hdfgroup.org/hug/hug24/), thus fostering greater collaboration and knowledge sharing within the community. HUG is the premier HDF community event at which HDF users and contributors catch up on the latest research, community projects, success stories, outstanding issues, and new use cases and requirements. 

Data sharing and providing efficient and equitable access to scientific and engineering data across platforms, now and into the future, are at the heart of The HDF Group‚Äôs mission. Research software engineering is an integral part of fulfilling that mission, and many if not most HDF users, developers, and contributors are research software engineers in some capacity. Because of US-RSE's presence at HUG, we were able to highlight this natural alliance, and we look forward to engaging with and participating in the RSE community.


## **Chemists Who Code ‚Äì Isaac Spackman**

![Chemists Who Code]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/spackman_sept_mtg_2024(3).jpg "Chemists Who Code")
  
**Summary**

US-RSE funding was used to provide refreshments to graduate and undergraduate students at 'Chemists Who Code' monthly meetings. These meetings at Colorado School of Mines are designed to assist graduate students with developing software to improve the reproducibility and efficiency of their work, and promote the use of programming and awareness of programming careers within the Chemistry field.

### **RSE Empowerment in National Labs**

The RSE Empowerment in National Labs working group is looking for US-RSE members to present in our ‚ÄúRSEs in the National Labs‚Äù series for our monthly calls in 2025! The goal of this series is to provide US-RSE members with a venue to hear about the diversity of experience working at the various US sponsored research institutions. If you are interested in presenting you experience, please reach out to the working group chairs.

The next RSE Empowerment in National Labs community call will be Thursday, October 24 at 3pm ET/ 2pm CT/ 1pm MT / 12pm PT and is open to all US-RSE members. We will have a post-US-RSE conference report back from the co-chairs and provide an opportunity for US-RSE members to discuss what they learned.  We will also hold a discussion on our plans for 2025 including setting up for our next co-chair nominations.   You can find a link to the call in the bookmarks section of the [#national-labs](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/national-labs) Slack channel.

Gateways 2024 is an opportunity for users, developers, and providers to showcase their science gateways, accommodating teaching, empowering and engaging research, and providing technologies to various communities. It will also offer diverse options for sharing and publishing work and networking in the community. The format includes tutorial sessions, presentations, panels, posters, demos, and a BYOP: Bring Your Own Portal. Being that Bozeman is in the big sky country, we want to focus on expanding the horizons of science gateways to include new communities and fields.

Impact of AI on Software Engineering

### **üí°Second Virtual Workshop on Multi-Project CI/CD**

The Multi-ProjectDevOps project was founded to establish best practices for decreasing the time needed to deploy multiple high-quality scientific software packages, particularly when the packages share common requirements. Key to these best practices are maintaining continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows. Since the managed packages share common requirements the CI/CD workflows will too. We define a multi-project CI/CD workflow as a CI/CD workflow that can be reused for multiple projects. The purpose of this workshop is to share best practices, lessons learned, and solutions for multi-project CI/CD.

Registration is free. To sign up please fill out this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6Q4g2X4DwY7MWQOSLjP0fRzs9iltZ8xhp1elesyhhuYK7Mw/viewform).


### **üí°Open Source Software for Fusion Energy (OSSFE) Conference**

The [Open Source Software for Fusion Energy (OSSFE) Conference](https://ossfe.github.io/) is a first-of-its-kind event dedicated to the development, use, and advancement of open-source software in the fusion energy community. Whether you're an experienced researcher, developer, or new to the field, OSSFE offers a collaborative platform to share insights, tools, and innovations that push the boundaries of fusion energy research.

# **8. Steering Committee Update**

While the Steering Committee newsletter updates took a break over the summer, the Steering Committee definitely did not! We had a busy and productive summer with many areas of focus.
* Yearly Budget: We finalized the 2024-2025 fiscal year budget. This involved many conversations about processes and precedents as the Steering Committee and Executive Director learned how best to work together, but resulted in what we are optimistic will be a sustainable budget and good communication practices for the future.
* US-RSE‚Äô25 Planning: We identified a second General Chair to share in the responsibility of organizing the US-RSE'25 conference and starting working out the financial and administrative logistics of having conference chairs who are separate from the Steering Committee (a first for our conference). We also discussed issues relating to US-RSE'24, including travel award details, program logistics and collaboration with outside organizations, and non-standard sponsorship opportunities outside those listed on our website.
* Organizational Membership: We spent considerable time with our Executive Director finalizing the details and presentation of our organizational membership program. This program is expected to launch before the end of the year and will be a way for organizations to increase their involvement with US-RSE while receiving some perks, as well as a way for US-RSE to raise funds for ongoing programs.
In addition to prioritizing these larger areas of focus, we covered a number of smaller topics, including Executive Director attendance at conferences, our next round of Community Funds awards, and the upcoming Steering Committee annual elections.
