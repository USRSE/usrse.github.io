# **Message from Our Executive Director Sandra Gesing and Our Community Manager Sophia Anyatonwu**

We are honored and thrilled to be appointed the inaugural Executive Director and inaugural Community Manager of US-RSE. The last five years have shown us how much we can achieve together as a community that has grown from around 20 members in 2018 to nearly 2000 in 2023. US-RSE is a vibrant community evident in the success of our first ever conference, active involvement on Slack, various working groups, organized workshops and participation in community calls – to name just a few. 

Much of the Executive Director's role will be focused on the sustainability of the organization and my (Sandra) vision is that we achieve financial sustainability with different tiers of funding and contributions. Volunteer work will stay a cornerstone of US-RSE. We both will contribute to this thriving community to address pain points and support activities that the community would like to accomplish. I (Sophia) will start with meeting with working groups, affinity groups and regional groups to identify pain points. We will have a wish list that can be filled by community members and prioritize the activities of our overall community.

We are looking forward to this journey with you all and we are grateful for any ideas and input! Please don’t hesitate to contact us. Happy holidays!

Sincerely,

[Sandra Gesing](mailto:sandra@us-rse.org) & [Sophia Anyatonwu](mailto:sophia@us-rse.org)

# **Two-year Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Grant**

The [generous grant](https://us-rse.org/2023-04-27-sloan-grant-initiatives/) by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation  will provide support in three important areas: the recruitment of dedicated staff, the development of activities and initiatives, and the enhancement of organizational tools and community well-being. 

* A large part of US-RSE’s success has been due to the dedication and hard work of volunteers. While we don’t want to see the community-driven nature change, we recognize that relying on pure volunteer effort is limiting. For this reason the two new staff positions of a full-time Community Manager and a part-time Executive Director were created. We are excited that Sophia Anyatonwu started on December 11, 2023 as our Community Manager and Sandra Gesing started on November 1, 2023 as our Executive Director (see their message above).
* Three main activities and initiatives will be funded through the grant: The US-RSE Annual Conference, a Community Funds Program, and an Awards Program.
* Developing and maintaining a vibrant and functional community network requires infrastructure. To alleviate the struggles of the current process, we’ll invest in infrastructure for managing contact information for those in the network, facilitating networking opportunities between members, allowing people to choose their level of involvement in network activities, and communicating with members. 

## Community and Travel Funds Program

Part of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant for US-RSE has been delegated for the Community and Travel Funds program. Members of US-RSE can apply for funds for community or individual purposes for event costs, get-togethers, travel funding, and more. The next deadline is **December 31, 2023**! See the [webpage](https://us-rse.org/grants-and-awards/) for more details.

# **US-RSE Conference 2023 Recap (US-RSE'23)**
Our [first ever US-RSE conference](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/) in October was a great success and was sold out with 250 attendees. We received 94 submissions of which we accepted 73 (4 tutorials, 3 workshops, 6 Birds of a Feather, 19 short/long papers, 25 talks, 15 posters, 2 notebooks). The [program](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/program/) featured additionally [2 keynotes](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/program/keynotes/), a [funding agency panel](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/program/sessions/#session-9-panel---funding-agencies), a student program, sponsor talks, a poster reception, conference dinner and a social hour. This all would not have been possible without the support and work of so many people: the [organizing committee](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/organization/), the reviewers, the [sponsors](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/), the authors and last but not least the attendees! Many thanks for a vibrant conference full of positive energy!

## Conference Summaries

[U-M developers attend first-ever US-RSE conference](https://michigan.it.umich.edu/news/2023/11/17/u-m-developers-attend-first-ever-us-rse-conference/) 

A contingent from U-M took part in the first-ever US-RSE (United States Research Software Engineer Association) annual conference. It was held at the University of Illinois Chicago, October 16–18, 2023. 

Abbey Roelofs and Michael Egan (College of Literature, Science, and the Arts), Srikanth Lavu (Marsal Family School of Education), and Andy Boughton (School of Public Health) attended the conference in person, and Mark Ciechanowski (Michigan Medicine), joined remotely for live-streamed sessions... *(Click the link above to read more)*

[A Tale of Two Conferences: Reflections from the US-RSE and ADSA Conferences](https://datascience.wisc.edu/2023/11/03/a-tale-of-two-conferences-reflections-from-the-us-rse-and-adsa-conferences/) 

...One question that kept coming up in my mind throughout the US-RSE conference was, “How do groups do code review?” I have long been obsessed with the idea that more research software/code should be reviewed before it is put into production or published. In theory, this sounds simple, but in practice it is much harder. Many research software engineers and data scientists are the sole developer on a project. And even if they work as part of a group, it is difficult to share enough context for them to effectively evaluate each other’s code. Ideally, you would have two or more developers working on a single project, but in the academic setting this is often financially infeasible. 

Luckily, the second day of the conference had a “Birds of a Feather” session to discuss code review. It seemed like a lot of the folks who attended had run into similar issues. The panelists presented several models for how they were managing code review in their communities. One was a community of practice in the digital humanities where individuals and teams can submit their work for review. This shared domain of expertise allows researchers to more easily review each other’s work, somewhat like journal submissions... *(Click the link above to read more)*

[DHTech Participation at US-RSE Conference](https://dh-tech.github.io/blog/2023/10/27/dhtech-at-usrse-conf/) 

Several DHTech members attended the inaugural US-RSE conference, an event by the US Research Software Engineer Association themed “Software-Enabled Discovery and Beyond.” While the majority of attendees hailed from STEM fields rather than the humanities or social sciences, common challenges, such as building sustainable and maintainable software, were universally recognized. The difficulty of building sustainable, maintainable, reproducible, and extensible software was a common refrain at the conference.

Jeffrey Carver, a DHTech member, conducted a half-day workshop on Software Engineering for Research Software Engineering (SE4RSE'23) alongside Neil Chue Hong and Miranda Mundt. Carver’s presentation on “Peer Code Review in Research Software: Enhancing Quality and Collaboration” explored the processes, challenges, and improvements required when RSEs conduct code reviews. His survey of code review practices revealed that code reviews regularly identify issues which are difficult to test or statically analyze; that many engineers have positive experiences with code review and that it improves team cohesion; and that most downsides of code review stem from social or incentive problems (too much time, misunderstanding criticism, difficult to find reviewers)... *(Click the link above to read more)*

## User Experience Working Group 
The User Experience Working Group (UXWG) is a newly formed working group. Co-chairs Drew Paine and Hannah Cohoon invite UX researchers and practitioners to join the working group in its effort to increase awareness of UX methods and promote its application in research software engineering. The UXWG offers an inclusive community of practice where members can share knowledge, experiences, and challenges. Together, UXWG members will advocate for and demystify UX to the larger RSE community, scientists across domains, and funding agency staff who support products and services. The working group plans to develop webinars, case studies, and white papers and invites new members to suggest other means for promoting UX methods in the research software community. To get involved, visit the [#wg-ux](https://app.slack.com/client/T8ZT4PJSW/C0664AMJBKQ) channel on the US-RSE slack or contact the co-chairs at wg-ux@us-rse.org.

## Community Calls
 
 
### January Community Call 

**Call for Presenters: Present Your Favorite Tools or Project!**

We are looking for people who would like to present their favorite tool or project at our next Community Call on Thursday, January 11th, at 12pm ET/9am PT/11am CST. Presentations would be 10-15 minutes long and you can present your own project or a tool you regularly use and think everybody should know about! If you are interested in presenting, please get in touch with Julia Damerow and Abbey Roelofs in the [#communitycalls](https://app.slack.com/client/T8ZT4PJSW/CLBDQMJH5) channel or by messaging them directly.


### December Community Call (Past)
**The December Community Call was on the topic of Fuzzy Requirements**

Have you been in the situation that a researcher you work with is unclear about the requirements for the software you are developing? How do you handle situations in which the requirements are conflicting, the goal of the project is unclear, or the focus is shifting frequently? This was an opportunity to share tools or techniques as well as brainstorm solutions with others who may have dealt with similar situations.


### November Community Call (Past)

**The November Community Call was a [discussion with our new Executive Director, Sandra Gesing](https://youtu.be/MzOne9PXa1I) about Envisioning the Next Stage for US-RSE and Synergies with the Center of Excellence for Science Gateways (SGX3)**


US-RSE has had a lot of momentum and positive energy from the beginning in 2017. It gained even more in the last couple of months evident in the rising numbers of members growing to over 2000 and the sold out inaugural conference in Chicago. The grant of the Sloan foundation allows for the first time that staff members can complement the volunteer effort: Sandra Gesing as the Executive Director at 50% and a soon-to-be-announced full-time community manager. These roles will take US-RSE to the next level beyond volunteer work. The other 50% of Sandra’s effort go to science gateways aka virtual research environments aka virtual labs, which are research software solutions that allow researchers to focus on their research and not on nitty-gritty details of complex research infrastructures. The community of RSEs and science gateways have quite some overlap. A common goal of both communities is the creation of non-traditional career paths  for RSEs and science gateway creators that are lacking in the academic and national lab world. The community call covered Sandra’s vision for the role of the executive director to achieve financial sustainability for US-RSE, collaboration via the Center of Excellence for Science Gateways (SGX3), and major tasks for the next couple of months.

# **US-RSE Financials**

From a financial perspective, 2023 was an exciting year for US-RSE. We were awarded a two-year grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and switched fiscal sponsors. We are very grateful to the Open Collective Foundation (OCF) that was our fiscal sponsor until last spring. However, with the awarded grant our needs changed and we are now a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](https://communityinitiatives.org/) (CI). CI gives us the structure and resources to hire staff such as the Executive Director Sandra Gesing and the Community Manager Sophia Anyatonwu, to accept donations and making it possible to reimburse members for expenses they incurred on behalf of US-RSE. The community funds possible via the Alfred P. Sloan grant are also awarded via CI.

The majority of the grant from the Sloan Foundation is budgeted to pay for our new Executive Director and Community Manager. Besides that we budgeted money to support staff travel, the US-RSE conference, to fund community activities through our new Travel and Community Fund program, and a couple of smaller items such code of conduct trainings for our code of conduct committee members. CI charges 10% of our income for providing resources, infrastructure, and support (trust us when we say we make good use of those resources). Switching from OCF to CI turned out to been an unexpectedly complex change and it has been a very steep learning curve. We appreciate our members' patience as we navigate the world of non-profit regulations and guidelines.
