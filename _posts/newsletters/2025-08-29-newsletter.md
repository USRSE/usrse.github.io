Thank you to all who have submitted work for this conference! We received an impressive 170 submissions across all tracks, with particularly strong interest in talks and posters. 
This contributed to a competitive peer review process and a slate of high quality material to look forward to. As an attendee, you can expect
a diverse program of interactive and educational content.

### 👯 Workshops & Talks

The [US-RSE’25 workshops](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/program/workshops/) offer a diverse range of hands-on, discussion-based, and technical sessions tailored to the needs of Research Software Engineers (RSEs). This year's 
topics will include workflow automation, software testing, Agile project management, user research, and sustainable data practices, and will highlight technologies like Pegasus 
workflows integrated with ACCESS resources and GPUs, Google Gemini AI tools, SLEAP for deep learning, CyVerse's CACAO platform for scalable AI/ML deployment, and practical instruction on user experience research methods like semi-structured interviews. We'll also explore broader themes such as preserving critical data repositories and recognizing 
software as scholarly output through a live demo of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).

Our [invited speakers](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/program/talks/) will explore key concepts and cutting-edge technologies in research software engineering including reproducibility, accessibility, sustainability, and community-driven development. Topics include FAIR compliance, multilingual translation using AI, integrating knowledge graphs for generative AI, improving documentation practices, and managing large-scale distributed data. Our speakers will also examine the role of project charters in the humanities, using notebooks as scholarly outputs, AI-augmented scientific workflows, and foundational principles of software engineering like modularity and abstraction. We're very excited to welcome a diverse group of speakers from academia, industry, and government labs who will share their expertise and insights on these important topics.

### 🗞️ Papers, Posters, Notebooks, & More

This year's accepted papers showcase the exciting growth of work in RSE, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility, sustainability, and real-world impact. These expert, 
peer-reviewed publications will tackle technical challenges, such as scalable testing for large simulation models, secure and reproducible containerized workflows, and 
GPU-accelerated generation of synthetic populations. Privacy-aware LLMs, enhancements to HPC education and infrastructure, and case studies on best practices are also going to be highlighted.

Meanwhile, the [poster sessions](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/program/posters/) will provide a chance for our community to showcase their applied projects and community-building efforts. Tools that improve accessibility, 
reproducibility, and usability are particularly exciting! Topics will range from AI’s role in code generation, to sustainability of large models, with applications ranging from pathology to climate science and education to infrastructure.

And, unique to USRSE, we have a special track for [Notebooks as Scholarly Outputs](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/program/notebooks/). This track recognizes the growing importance of computational notebooks in research and education. Our notebook showcase will demonstrate best practices in reproducibility, documentation, and sharing, and will include topics relevant to drug discovery pipelines, the uncertainty of datetimes in code, and large scale imaging files. Lastly, keep an eye out for our Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions, which will provide an informal setting for attendees to discuss shared interests and challenges in RSE.

### 🎤 Keynotes

We have two fantastic [keynote speakers](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/program/keynotes/) attending! On Monday, Dr. Reed Maxwell (Princeton University) will present his groundbreaking work on simulating groundwater at continental scales by integrating machine learning with physics-based hydrologic models. His team’s CONUS2.1 and HydroFrame platforms aim to create a digital twin of the full U.S. hydrologic cycle—reducing computational costs while capturing the nonlinear interactions between groundwater and surface water systems. His talk will highlight the development of ML emulators, the use of simulation-based inference, and how this fusion of data and models enables more efficient and scalable hydrologic forecasting.

On Tuesday, Dr. Myra Cohen (Iowa State University) will address the growing challenges of ensuring software correctness, especially as AI becomes more deeply embedded in research workflows. Her keynote will focus on system-level testing for scientific software—where uncertainty, complexity, and domain specificity make traditional validation approaches difficult. Dr. Cohen will explore how exactness is often unattainable and how we can adapt our testing strategies to maintain confidence in research outcomes. Drawing on her expertise in configurable systems and interdisciplinary approaches, she will offer practical techniques and a thoughtful perspective on what it means to build trustworthy research software in an era increasingly shaped by AI.

    title="Open Innovation Sprint" 
    preamble="
Research software is the engine driving modern science and discovery. From analyzing complex datasets to simulating intricate phenomena, it's an indispensable part of the research lifecycle. Yet, understanding and quantifying its impact remains a significant challenge for researchers, project contributors, institutions, and funders alike.

How do we effectively measure the reach and influence of these vital tools? How can we incentivize better practices around software citation, metadata, and sustainability?

To tackle these shared ecosystem challenges head-on, [NumFOCUS’s](https://numfocus.org/) [Open Source Science Initiative](http://opensource.science/) launched the 2025 “Impact of Research Software” Open Innovation Sprint!

Running from March through late 2025, this sprint is a collaborative, fast-paced initiative bringing together researchers, engineers, designers, community organizers, and users. Our goal is to produce actionable, community-driven outputs – open source tools ready for immediate use and contribution.

This inaugural sprint, focused on measuring research software impact, is inspired by efforts such as the [CZI 2023 Software Impact Hackathon](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/software-impact-hackathon-2023), is led by NumFOCUS’s Open Source Science Initiative, and is made possible through collaboration with the [Research Software Alliance (ReSA)](https://www.researchsoft.org/), [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) and [ecosyste.ms](http://ecosyste.ms/), and the Sprint’s contributors and their organizations.

To be held as part of SC25, St. Louis, MO, USA (where US-RSE will have a dedicated booth) and online, Sunday, November 16, 2025, 8:30 am - 5:00 pm CST (UTC-6)

**=== Overview ===**

Research software engineers (RSEs) are critical to the impact of HPC, data science, and the larger scientific community. They have existed for decades, though often not under that name. The past several years, however, have seen the development of the RSE concept, common job titles, and career paths; the creation of professional networks to connect RSEs; and the emergence of RSE groups at universities, national laboratories, and industry.
This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders. We'll hear about successes and challenges that RSEs and RSE groups have experienced, and discuss ways to increase awareness of RSE opportunities and improve support for RSEs.

The workshop will be highly interactive, featuring breakout discussions and panels, as well as invited addresses and submitted talks.

    title="From Code to Clarity: What Makes Good Docs?" 
    when="Tuesday Sept 2 at 12pm Eastern" 
    where="Online via Zoom"
    preamble="The CASS UDX working group will meet Tuesday Sept 2 at 12pm Eastern to talk about documentation, a key aspect of UX for scientific software.
    
Effective documentation is crucial for the success of any software project, but it's especially vital in the world of academic and scientific research. In this talk, leaders from The Good Docs Project will explain why documentation matters, including helping users quickly onboard, streamlining troubleshooting efforts, and accelerating problem-solving.

They will then break down the core principles that set truly great documentation apart, including being task-focused, well-structured, and written from the user's point of view. We'll also leave you with some practical strategies for integrating documentation seamlessly into your existing development workflow and processes using the docs-as-code framework. This will empower you and your colleagues to maintain high-quality docs alongside your code, without the extra overhead.
Whether you're new to writing documentation or looking for ways to enhance your existing practices, this talk will empower you to take your software documentation to the next level."

    title="Application of the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program to Scientific Software" 
    when="September 24 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm EDT" 
    where="Online via Zoom"
    preamble="The Linux Foundation’s OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program represents an impressive collection of the open-source community’s knowledge base for creating, maintaining, and sustaining robust, high-quality, and secure open-source software. At its foundation is a featureful “Badge App” website, which provides a database of projects that document what best practices they have adopted and supporting evidence. This set of best practices (along with the detailed documentation and supporting justifications for each item) also serve as an incremental learning tool and as a foundation for incremental software process and quality improvement efforts. This webinar will provide an overview of this effort and describe some of its surprising benefits. The webinar will also explain how the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program can be utilized to continue recent advances in software quality and sustainability efforts within the computational science and engineering community.
We also describe the experiences, challenges, and benefits from two HPC software projects, MPICH and Ginkgo, which have completed OpenSSF Best Practices passing badges. Developing and maintaining MPICH is a significant software engineering challenge, and the MPICH team has developed processes for testing, verification, collaboration, and community outreach. We will discuss the lessons learned from developing MPICH and how the OpenSSF best practices map to the MPICH project. We will also discuss how we achieved the OpenSSF badge for Ginkgo, and the process involved. In addition, will briefly discuss the benefits of the badge and its effects on sustainable software development."
