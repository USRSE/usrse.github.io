**[Software Sustainability: Research on Usability, Maintainability, and Reproducibility Minitrack](https://hicss.hawaii.edu/tracks-58/software-technology/#software-sustainability-research-on-usability-maintainability-and-reproducibility-minitrack)**

This minitrack is dedicated to exploring the critical intersection of software usability, sustainability, and reproducibility, acknowledging the expanding role of software in shaping research across diverse domains. The three concepts usability, sustainability and reproducibility are interconnected with each other and cover a wide range of application areas. They affect all layers of the software process – from enabling reproducing experiments via an easy user interface to using containerization for application portability. Such concepts are also relevant in the building of Science Gateways (also known as virtual laboratories or virtual research environments), which by definition serve communities with end-to-end solutions tailored specifically to their needs. The mini-track will focus on the broad spectrum of submissions that deal with complex scenarios such as containerization, strategies for long-lasting software, usability and user interface issues, handling data curation and provenance and more.

## DH2024 Mini-conference “DH Inside Out”

This year in August, the [Digital Humanities Conference 2024](https://dh2024.adho.org/) (DH2024) will be held at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia, USA. [DHTech](https://dh-tech.github.io/), a community of people developing digital humanities software, will hold a mini-conference at DH2024 themed “DH Inside Out”. Typical DH conference presentations are focussed on the research with a slight nod to the technical details; the mini-conference wants to flip that format and dive more deeply into the technical aspects of the work, while still keeping it in context of the research and domain specifics. To that end, DHTech invites submissions of interest to the people who work on the technical aspects of DH projects.  Please see the full call [on the DHTech website](https://dh-tech.github.io/blog/2023/12/19/dh-inside-out-dh2024/) for instructions on how to submit presentation proposals.

<a name="financials"></a>
# **US-RSE Financials**

From a financial perspective, 2023 was an exciting year for US-RSE. We were awarded a two-year grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and switched fiscal sponsors. We are very grateful to the Open Collective Foundation (OCF) that was our fiscal sponsor until last spring. However, with the awarded grant our needs changed and we are now a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](https://communityinitiatives.org/) (CI). CI gives us the structure and resources to hire staff such as the Executive Director and the Community Manager, accept donations and reimburse members for expenses they incurred on behalf of US-RSE. The community funds possible via the Alfred P. Sloan grant are also awarded via CI.

The majority of the grant from the Sloan Foundation is budgeted to pay for our new Executive Director and Community Manager. Besides that we've budgeted money to support staff travel, the US-RSE conference, fund community activities through our new Community and Travel Fund program, and fund smaller items such as code of conduct trainings for our code of conduct committee members. CI charges 10% of our income for providing resources, infrastructure, and support (trust us when we say we make good use of those resources). Switching from OCF to CI turned out to been an unexpectedly complex change and it has been a very steep learning curve. We appreciate our members' patience as we navigate the world of non-profit regulations and guidelines.
