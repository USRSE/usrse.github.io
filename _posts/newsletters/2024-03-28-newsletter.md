# **Steering Committee Recap**
In January 2024, the Steering Committee welcomed three newly elected Steering Committee members and determined roles for 2024. As part of this process, we discussed how some roles will be changing and responsibilities shifting with the addition of our Executive Director (Sandra Gesing) and Community Manager (Sophia Anyatonwu). In addition, a new role of Deputy Treasurer was added to serve as a backup for and share some work of the Treasurer. Ian Cosden remains the US-RSE Steering Committee Chair, and the [complete list](https://us-rse.org/about/steering-committee/) of roles is available on the website.

In late February, the Steering Committee held its annual strategic planning meeting to talk about priorities for the coming year as well as long-term plans. A blog post with full details will be coming soon, but some of the highlights of conversation included 5-year visions for US-RSE, exploring potential membership models for the organization, recognizing and supporting working group volunteers, and balancing differing opinions and viewpoints within the organization.

The topics identified in the strategic planning meeting have informed the discussions at subsequent meetings. Current priorities include a formal membership program for organizations interested in supporting US-RSE, piloting a recognition program for active Slack community members, identifying fundraising opportunities, and better understanding our current membership. Many of these efforts are being led by Sophia and Sandra, who regularly attend Steering Committee meetings.

## RSE Empowerment in National Labs



### Community building in your organization guide

Members of the US-RSE National Labs working group  recently teamed up to write an article called, ["Getting Started with the RSE Movement within your Organization: A Guide for Individuals"](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10436166).

This guide is all about helping folks who want to jump into the RSE movement within their own organizations. We've added some practical steps and tips to help you make a difference by bringing RSEs together and building a strong community. Hopefully, the community will find it useful!

### Working group participation in upcoming conferences

A number of working group members will be participating in conferences this coming April in which they'll be sharing the experience of being an RSE working in national labs. These include a panel discussion at [Sandia National Laboratories Sustainable Scientific Software Conference (S3C)](https://s3c.sandia.gov/), and presentations at the [UCAR Improving Scientific Software Conference (ISS)](https://sea.ucar.edu/conference/2024) and the [Salishan Conference on High Speed Computing](https://salishan.ahsc-nm.org/).

## DH2024 Mini-conference “DH Inside Out”

This year in August, the [Digital Humanities Conference 2024](https://dh2024.adho.org/) (DH2024) will be held at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia, USA. [DHTech](https://dh-tech.github.io/), a community of people developing digital humanities software, will hold a mini-conference at DH2024 themed “DH Inside Out”. Typical DH conference presentations are focussed on the research with a slight nod to the technical details; the mini-conference wants to flip that format and dive more deeply into the technical aspects of the work, while still keeping it in context of the research and domain specifics. To that end, DHTech invites submissions of interest to the people who work on the technical aspects of DH projects.  Please see the full call [on the DHTech website](https://dh-tech.github.io/blog/2023/12/19/dh-inside-out-dh2024/) for instructions on how to submit presentation proposals.

# **US-RSE Financials**

From a financial perspective, 2023 was an exciting year for US-RSE. We were awarded a two-year grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and switched fiscal sponsors. We are very grateful to the Open Collective Foundation (OCF) that was our fiscal sponsor until last spring. However, with the awarded grant our needs changed and we are now a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](https://communityinitiatives.org/) (CI). CI gives us the structure and resources to hire staff such as the Executive Director and the Community Manager, accept donations and reimburse members for expenses they incurred on behalf of US-RSE. The community funds possible via the Alfred P. Sloan grant are also awarded via CI.

The majority of the grant from the Sloan Foundation is budgeted to pay for our new Executive Director and Community Manager. Besides that we've budgeted money to support staff travel, the US-RSE conference, fund community activities through our new Community and Travel Fund program, and fund smaller items such as code of conduct trainings for our code of conduct committee members. CI charges 10% of our income for providing resources, infrastructure, and support (trust us when we say we make good use of those resources). Switching from OCF to CI turned out to been an unexpectedly complex change and it has been a very steep learning curve. We appreciate our members' patience as we navigate the world of non-profit regulations and guidelines.  



<a name="involved"></a>
# **Get Involved**
