Daniel S. Katz applied for and was selected to receive travel funding that allowed him to attend the 4th German Conference on Research Software Engineering (deRSE24, [https://events.hifis.net/event/994/](https://events.hifis.net/event/994/)) in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, in March. He gave a 30-minute talk there on US-RSE, co-authored with Ian Cosden and Jeffrey C. Carver, titled "US-RSE: Todayâ€™s successes and tomorrowâ€™s challenges." Slides from the presentation, which were prepared and then discussed with current and past steering US-RSE committee members, are available at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10732103](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10732103). 

In addition to giving this talk, Dan enjoyed the overall conference, where he was able to catch up with some collaborators and members of the community he already knew, and to meet new colleagues, particularly during the meals, poster session, and social events. Some of the workshops, such as one on FAIR and Reproducible Code, organized by Heidi Seibold and others, were quite interesting, and there were also sessions that Dan enjoyed on building community around software, and RSE research, sustainable organization, and RSE community. The RSE research session in particular was interesting to Dan, as it was a topic that he also has seen in the UK RSECons, but that didn't appear as one of the topics in US-RSE'23. 

Overall, Dan is thankful to US-RSE and the Sloan Foundation for the opportunity to attend this conference, share information about US-RSE and other topics, and to learn what's going on in Germany that can be used in the US.

*Part of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant for US-RSE has been delegated for the [Community and Travel Funds program](https://us-rse.org/funds-and-awards/). Members of US-RSE can apply for funds for community or individual purposes for event costs, get-togethers, travel funding, and more.*

# **2. Membership Benefits**  

The US-RSE leadership team (Executive Director, Community Manager, and Steering Committee) has been strategizing about how to bring additional membership benefits to you, our valued members. We are excited to bring a new benefit, one that we hope is the first of many new tangible benefits for US-RSE members!

Weâ€™ve negotiated/partnered with the [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/) to bring discounted rates to their upcoming conference. Agile Alliance is a global non-profit membership organization founded on the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/). They support people and organizations who explore, apply and expand Agile values, principles, and practices. There is some clear overlap with US-RSE with goals in regard to agile development and material that can benefit people in agile software development and/or agile management.

Agile Alliance has their [Agile 2024 conference](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile2024/) from July 22-26th, 2024 at the Gaylord Texan. As a US-RSE member you can get **$200** off the registration fee with this code specifically for US-RSE **AA21US-RSE!**

Do you have suggestions for other organizations that could be potential US-RSE partners? Or other member benefits that youâ€™d like to see? If so email [sandra@us-rse.org](mailto:sandra@us-rse.org).

### **Member Spotlight - Greg Lemieux** 
![Greg Lemieux]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2024_EESA_Lemieux resized.jpg "Greg Lemieux"){:height="215px" width="300px"}


**Background**

Hi! My name is Greg.

I have a background in aerospace engineering that was fueled by childhood dreams of space exploration and becoming an astronaut. 

After completing an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering, I went on to become a mission designer gaining experience in both academic and industry settings. As a flight engineer working on a number of research missions at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, I started off writing simple scripts and conducting analyses on mission planning tasks. I then decided to move from research into industry where I worked for Maxar Space Systems, a company that makes Sirius XM Radio, DirectTV, and other communications spacecraft for various governments and private entities around the world. During this time, I was an orbit analyst and then a guidance, navigation and controls engineer. 

**Research Software Engineering**

Eventually, I found that I enjoyed writing mathematical and scientific software. I realized that I wanted to do more of this and decided to go back to school part-time to get a Master's degree at Purdue University. My major was in interdisciplinary engineering with a focus in computational engineering. In the end, I decided to leave industry to pursue the scientific software engineering roles that I was seeking. The JuliaCon conference in 2018 was pivotal in directing me towards a career in Research Software Engineering. I had enjoyed my time at the Space Sciences Lab at UC Berkeley and am thankful to have eventually ended up down the hill from there at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 

I currently work as a software developer in the Climate and Ecosystem Science division on the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) Model. I often tell people that I am living as close as one can get to having their dream job.

**US-RSE Involvement**

I co-chair the US-RSE RSE Empowerment in National Labs Working Group. Members from our working group recently collaborated together to design, deliver, and analyze group surveys as well as focus group discussions. We also presented on our working group efforts at the 2024 UCAR Improving Scientific Software conference. This year, we plan to further describe and effectively characterize the larger national lab population within US-RSE.

# **7. Steering Committee Update**

In April 2024, the Steering Committee continued to look at logistics for the upcoming US-RSE'24 conference, identified a preferred potential location for US-RSE'25, and began conversations with a potential conference chair at this location. We also discussed and approved a proposal from the Executive Director to work with Agile Alliance to give our members a discount to their conference and continued to discuss organizational memberships. We heard from members of the Community and Travel Funds Committee about a shortage of reviewers for the recent round of submissions, and several Steering Committee members volunteered to assist in the review process. Finally, the Community Awards Committee chairs shared that the first round of community award recipients have been identified and will be announced at the end of May.
