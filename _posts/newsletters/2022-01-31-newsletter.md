# **International RSE Survey**

The [2021 RSE Survey](https://softwaresaved.limequery.com/386272?lang=en) is still open. You don’t need to be called an RSE to complete the survey. Your formal job title does not matter: we want to hear from you if you develop software for academic research as part of your work. The survey provides considerable detail about the RSE role: a person’s route into the role, the type of work they conduct, their working practices, job satisfaction and demographics. This means it takes around 20 minutes to complete. We appreciate that this is a significant amount of your time to donate - and we thank you for it!

We strongly encourage you to respond to the survey and to share it with others who may be interested. The results of this survey will be greatly beneficial to US-RSE as we move forward. The more responses we have, the better our knowledge.

For more details on the survey visit [https://software.ac.uk/news/complete-international-rse-survey-and-help-us-understand-rse-community](https://software.ac.uk/news/complete-international-rse-survey-and-help-us-understand-rse-community).

You can complete the 2021-2022 RSE survey in [English](https://softwaresaved.limequery.com/386272?lang=en), [French](https://softwaresaved.limequery.com/386272?lang=fr), [German](https://softwaresaved.limequery.com/386272?lang=de-informal), or [Spanish](https://softwaresaved.limequery.com/386272?lang=es).

<a name="workshop"></a>
# **US-RSE Community Workshop**

We are excited to announce that the first US-RSE Association [community building workshop](https://us-rse.org/first-community-workshop/) will be held April 26-27, 2022 in Princeton, NJ, after two years of delays due to COVID-19! This will be a workshop focused on planning the best path forward to grow the US-RSE Association.

<a name="community-calls"></a>
# **US-RSE Community Calls**

The February community call will be on February 10, 2022 at 12 ET. We will be talking about Testing Frameworks and Processes.

Most developers will agree that testing is an important part of software development. But is testing of research software any different than testing of other types of software? Is testing in a research context different from testing in general software enterprises? And how and what do you test in the first place? What can we learn from each other and from practices elsewhere?

 The call will discuss, and share knowledge and experiences, around questions such as why you would want to test and what the benefits are, what technologies are out there, and what processes RSEs do (and don’t) employ to test their software. No matter if you have never heard of testing or if you are an expert, come join us for an interesting discussion and to hear and share some "testimonies" of what has worked and not worked for others.

We have also changed the way we organize community calls. We meet two week prior to each community call to decide on a topic and discuss how to structure the call. Anyone is welcome to join the preparation call on [Zoom](https://mit.zoom.us/j/93471607274?pwd=aXUzNzZsWElpWnc4N2NXaWxOcVNlQT09).

<a name="podcast"></a>
# **RSE Stories Podcast**

The [Research Software Engineer Stories podcast](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/) has two new episodes posted. Check them out below!

RSE Stories is looking for a new co-host and other volunteers to help with production. You don’t need to commit to anything: start with one episode and go from there. Interested? Reach out to Vanessa via Slack.

<a name="scipy"></a>
# **US-RSE at SciPy 2022**

US-RSE members plan to submit a proposal for a [Birds of a Feather session at SciPy 2022](https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/bof-sessions) about US-RSE. This will be a moderated panel discussion. If you are planning to attend SciPy 2022 in July in Austin and interested in representing US-RSE on the panel, please fill out this form: [https://forms.gle/Mx4qW1zH518Ev2Cm6](https://forms.gle/Mx4qW1zH518Ev2Cm6)

[Submissions are also open](https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/participate) for talks, posters, and tutorials at SciPy 2022. Please consider submitting if you are working with Python in any capacity.

<a name="sc22"></a>
# **US-RSE at [SC22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/)**

We have reserved a 10’ x 10’ small booth space for [SC22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org) in November. Global health situations willing, we hope to be at location 4214 with some of our RSE friends from around the world. The US-RSE #sc22 Slack channel will be starting soon. We look forward to chatting and brainstorming about fun RSE uses for a cozy 100 square foot space, and maybe answering the vexing question of how many RSEs can fit in a telephone booth.

<a name="financials"></a>
# **US-RSE Financials**

We’re excited to announce that  our t-shirt fundraiser raised $1643.66! The funds will appear in the US-RSE account soon. These funds will go toward the US-RSE [financial goals](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19-yTp2Q4SWP5ZiYb3VJa82hflc0p5FkeuhKWlIbwsD4) outlined in the AGM meeting. There are now 112 US-RSE logo shirts and hoodies out there in the wild. We look forward to seeing pictures of them in action around the US-RSE universe and hearing about their new lives and adventures wherever they go.

### Fundraising group starting

Following the awesome success of the t-shirt and  fund-drive we are launching a fund-raising channel on Slack and welcome anyone interested to join. If you are excited about helping raise money toward our current annual $5000/year (or more!) goal please feel free to join the fun. We are open to any and all ideas and expect to organize several fundraising activities during 2022. All the funds will go to the US-RSE organization’s financial goals and mission.

### 2021 financial gift shoutouts

Huge **thanks** to everyone who contributed financially in 2021. In total in 2021 there were 26 gifts to US-RSE. Many thanks to everyone who gave, both named and anonymous financial gifts. Shoutouts to Struan Clark, Ian Cosden, Julia Damerow, Chris Hill, Paul Hsi, Daniel Katz, Joseph H. Kennedy, Constantine Khrulev, Brendan Krueger, Sarom Leang, Christina Maimone, Marshall McDonnell, Lauren Milechin, Rafael Mudafort, Miranda Mundt, David Nicholson, Lance Parsons, Anya Peterson, Luke Rasmussen, Andrea Rubinstein, Vanessa Sochat, Kelly Sovacool, Blaise Thompson, Gaurav Vaidya and Jeff Wagner for your financial contributions.

### See how we are doing financially

We organize US-RSE financials transparently via the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/usrse) project. You can see all budgets, expenses, and contributions on [this site](https://opencollective.com/usrse). Anyone can go to the site and see the current accounts, income and expenses and …..

# **2022 Steering Committee Members and Their Roles**

Each year, the new US-RSE Steering Committee discusses the roles that are defined in US-RSE's [governance rules](https://us-rse.org/about/governance/) as well as other needed assignments (i.e., International RSE Council members), and determines who will fill each role. This year, the results are:

* Chair: Ian Cosden
* Vice-Chair: Sandra Gesing
* Election Chair: Christina Maimone
* Treasurer: Julia Damerow
* Secretary: Jeffrey Carver
* [International RSE Council](https://researchsoftware.org/council.html) members: Nicole Brewer, Daniel S. Katz

# **Get Involved**

There are lots of ways to get involved with the US-RSE community. Of course, you can [join us on Slack](https://us-rse.org/join) or volunteer for an interview with the RSE Stories podcast. But we’re also looking for ideas and help in many other places. See our [list of projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjVD0WkeeWZJI6yqSKyMdIjtClzolsxv75RkpLju17I/edit?usp=sharing) and let us know how you’d like to help.
