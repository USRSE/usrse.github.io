Welcome to this month’s edition of the US-RSE Newsletter! A few weeks ago, I found myself wondering: Who visits the US-RSE website? What are they looking for? How are they finding us? To satisfy that curiosity, I took a dive into our Google Analytics data, and uncovered some interesting patterns. In this issue, we’ll explore a few highlights from our website traffic that offer a glimpse into how our community is connecting with US-RSE online, and consider what these insights might mean for the future of our digital presence.

# 🔍 **2. A Peek at the US-RSE Website — What Brings You Here?**

<!-- Add monthly theme / highlight -->

Web analytics is a fascinating and exciting application
of data science involving the measurement, collection,
analysis, and reporting of web data to understand and
optimize website usage. Using a few simple techniques and powerful tools like Google Analytics 4, organizations like ours can learn incredible insights about who visits our website, what they do with it, and why. So, what does the US-RSE.org website data over the last 12 months tell us about ourselves?

### Top Pages

When not accounting for the home page, we can see that **the jobs page**
is the most utilized resource on the website. This is closely followed by conference
page resources:

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newsletter-202506/top_pages_table.png" alt="Top Pages" style="width: 750px; height: auto;">
</p>

I believe this reflects the current job market in the tech and academic world. At US-RSE,
we are committed to connecting talented individuals with exciting opportunities, so we try
to automate and streamline the process as much as we can with a Job Board bot
on Slack for job seekers, and and an easy-to-use [job posting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYK64R1c0rj-ERldGLxuqedLIbsYPZXj9uBplDRYNmnND10Q/viewform) for job posters. 
It's encouraging to see that our job board is a valuable resource for our community. 

<!-- Decidedly uninteresting or cannot nail down the data in time
### Traffic Sources
### Top Referrers
-->


### Geography

The US makes up the vast majority of our traffic, of course. But get this — we have page 
views pinging from 153 different countries and territories, including Northern Mariana 
Islands, Slovakia, Tajikstan, and Zimbabwe. However, _we have to consider the possibility of 
bots, crawlers, and VPNs_ inflating these numbers, so we should take this with a grain of salt.

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newsletter-202506/world_map.png" alt="Geography" style="width: 750px; height: auto;">
</p>

### Devices & Browsers

As you'd expect, most visitors come from desktop devices, with the most popular browsers being Chrome and Safari.

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newsletter-202506/device_types.png" alt="Devices" style="width: 750px; height: auto;">
</p>

What surprises me is the poor representation of 
privacy-focused tools like Firefox, Opera, and Brave. **Perhaps online privacy
consciousness would be an interesting topic for a future community call?**

### Bounce Rate & Engagement

We found that overall the **average engagement time per active user per month is 1m 06s**. Per 
session of using our site, the **average engagement time is only 38 seconds**. This is quite
low, and may suggest that visitors are mostly landing at the site in order to redirect elsewhere (such as during a job search). So, it begs the question: how can we improve the experience on the website to encourage users to visit and stay longer, and ultimately  explore more? What do _you_ expect to interact with when you visit the US-RSE website? How can we make visiting the site more valuable for you? Let us know by pinging the Slack #website channel...

### Trends

That being said, this writer is proud to report that our website has had an overall increase
in traffic since we reinvigorated the newsletter in March.

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newsletter-202506/visit_trend.png" alt="Trends" style="width: 750px; height: auto;">
</p>

### New vs. Returning Visitors

The comparison between new and returning visitors is a great way to measure the growth of our community. We can see that the number of returning users spikes quickly after the conference,
and dwindles slowly as people move on to other things. New user attraction should be a priority, however, so _we should think about ways to keep that post conference momentum going_.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newsletter-202506/new_users.png" alt="New Visitors" style="width: 45%; height: auto;">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newsletter-202506/returning_users.png" alt="Returning Visitors" style="width: 45%; height: auto;">
</div>

### Conclusion

Web analytics can offer a valuable snapshot of how a community and visiting audiences engage with a digital organization. For us, the data highlights the importance of our job board, and the (potentially) global reach of our resources, but also points out opportunities to improve engagement and retention. And this is just a basic breakdown of stock charts provided by the Google Analytics4 service... what more could we uncover as we dig into deeper data points?

As US-RSE continues to grow, your feedback will be essential in shaping the tools, resources, and interfaces we implement for the community. So, we ask you — _what would make the US-RSE website more useful?_ Share your thoughts in the #website Slack channel by joining the org and signing up to the slack group Slack [here](https://us-rse.org/get-involved/). Together, we can make us-rse.org an even more vibrant hub for research software engineers!

### **Community Calls**

<!--Community call news goes here-->

During our last community call, we got some great suggestions for future topics, including lots of interest in learning about the US-RSE community, careers, and funding. **Our July community call on Thursday, July 10, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT will cover all of these topics (and maybe more!).** 

If you'd like to give a brief 3-5 minute talk on your story, we'd be happy to hear from you. This could be talking about what your current role is and what you're working on, how you're funded, or the path you took to get where you are today. Even if you're not an RSE, you're here, so you're part of our community, and we'd love to hear what you do and how your work relates to RSE.

Please reach out to Julia Damerow or Abbey Roelofs via Slack if you're interested in presenting, and visit the [Community Calls Website](https://us-rse.org/events/category/#community-call) for more information and to access the registration link.

***June Community Call***   

In our last community call, we discussed the use of AI tools in research software engineering. From the Mentimeter poll, we learned that the majority of you are using AI tools once or twice a day for — obviously — coding support, and that you believe that if AI became sentient, the first thing it would do is... worship cats...? Y'know, sounds about right 🐈

    title="Call for abstracts: Research Software Engineers in HPC (RSE-HPC-2025)" 
    preamble="
To be held as part of SC25, St. Louis, MO, USA and online, Sunday, November 16, 2025, 8:30 am - 5:00 pm CST (UTC-6)

**=== Overview ===**

Research software engineers (RSEs) are critical to the impact of HPC, data science, and the larger scientific community. They have existed for decades, though often not under that name. The past several years, however, have seen the development of the RSE concept, common job titles, and career paths; the creation of professional networks to connect RSEs; and the emergence of RSE groups at universities, national laboratories, and industry.
This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders. We'll hear about successes and challenges that RSEs and RSE groups have experienced, and discuss ways to increase awareness of RSE opportunities and improve support for RSEs.

The workshop will be highly interactive, featuring breakout discussions and panels, as well as invited addresses and submitted talks.

**=== Submissions ===**

We encourage prospective participants to submit abstracts of proposed lightning talks (limit of 1 page, no format prescribed) on topics related to RSE issues. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

- Career paths: how should RSEs be hired, promoted and evaluated?Building RSE organizations: how to find RSEs in your country/region and how to motivate them to join the network and engage?
- Supporting RSE organizations: what can be done to help RSEs (and those supporting RSEs) at international, national, regional, and local levels?
- Making the business case for RSEs and RSE groups: evidence, case studies, tactics
- How do we want funders to support RSE roles and activities?
- Building in RSE requirements as part of wider research infrastructure
- Providing mentoring and training for RSEs
- How will RSEs contribute to new technologies such as AI/ML, quantum computing, neuromorphic computing?

The authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to present lightning talks or participate in panel discussions at the workshop. Note that SC25 is planning an in-person event and presenting in-person is encouraged. A supporting digital experience will accommodate those who cannot attend in-person due to travel restrictions or health concerns.

We particularly encourage submissions from first-time conference presenters, and from members of groups that have historically been underrepresented in the HPC community. **The deadline for submissions is Friday, August 8, 2025, at 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12).**

    title="Generative AI in the Workplace Survey📊" 
    preamble="
The Academic Data Science Alliance, US Research Software Engineer Association, and Schmidt Sciences are working together to uncover how Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and those in adjacent workspaces (e.g., research team members, data scientists) are using Generative AI in the workplace.

The goals of this survey are to capture broad “state of the field” information and to help define topic areas for a set of convenings with the RSE community over the coming year. These convenings are intended to dig into the details of AI use in the RSE workplace: to understand what’s already happening, identify key challenges and opportunities, and explore how RSEs themselves can actively shape the future of AI-augmented research software engineering."

    title="Open Innovation Sprint" 
    preamble="
Research software is the engine driving modern science and discovery. From analyzing complex datasets to simulating intricate phenomena, it's an indispensable part of the research lifecycle. Yet, understanding and quantifying its impact remains a significant challenge for researchers, project contributors, institutions, and funders alike.

How do we effectively measure the reach and influence of these vital tools? How can we incentivize better practices around software citation, metadata, and sustainability?

To tackle these shared ecosystem challenges head-on, [NumFOCUS’s](https://numfocus.org/) [Open Source Science Initiative](http://opensource.science/) launched the 2025 “Impact of Research Software” Open Innovation Sprint!

Running from March through late 2025, this sprint is a collaborative, fast-paced initiative bringing together researchers, engineers, designers, community organizers, and users. Our goal is to produce actionable, community-driven outputs – open source tools ready for immediate use and contribution.

This inaugural sprint, focused on measuring research software impact, is inspired by efforts such as the [CZI 2023 Software Impact Hackathon](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/software-impact-hackathon-2023), is led by NumFOCUS’s Open Source Science Initiative, and is made possible through collaboration with the [Research Software Alliance (ReSA)](https://www.researchsoft.org/), [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) and [ecosyste.ms](http://ecosyste.ms/), and the Sprint’s contributors and their organizations.

    title="Using Generative AI for Coding Tasks in Scientific Software" 
    when="July 09 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm EDT" 
    where="Online, 🌐"
    preamble="
The advent of large language models (LLMs) has generated a great deal of interest in their use for coding tasks. However, a well-known limitation of LLMs is that there are no guarantee of either truthfulness or correctness for the generated results. Therefore, we are not yet in a position where human intervention can be eliminated from these coding tasks, particularly in scientific computing where training data has been sparse and software is exploratory. We have been exploring the use for generative AI for a diverse set of tasks in scientific software development, including translation from Fortran to C++, writing code for a new algorithm, and refactoring existing code. A robust verification methodology has emerged as the most important component of accomplishing any coding task reliably with LLM assistance. In this webinar we will share our insights from our explorations.

Presented by Anshu Dubey (Argonne National Laboratory), and Akash Dhruv (Argonne National Laboratory)

> Editor's Note: This study investigates the neural and behavioral effects of using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for essay writing, and stirred up quite some discussion on slack. Using EEG and NLP analysis, the authors found that reliance on LLMs is associated with reduced brain connectivity, diminished memory recall, and lower self-reported ownership of written work, which suggests that long-term use may incur cognitive costs and hinder learning. Even as I write this newsletter, I find myself using an LLM to help me write `liquid` code snippets, quickly format HTML, and edit wording. This article is extremely timely and well worth a read as we continue to understand the potential effects of LLMs on our wellbeing.
