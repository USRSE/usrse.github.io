# **Two-year Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Grant**

The [generous grant](https://us-rse.org/2023-04-27-sloan-grant-initiatives/) by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation  will provide support in three important areas: the recruitment of dedicated staff, the development of activities and initiatives, and the enhancement of organizational tools and community well-being. 

* A large part of US-RSE’s success has been due to the dedication and hard work of volunteers. While we don’t want to see the community-driven nature change, we recognize that relying on pure volunteer effort is limiting. For this reason the two new staff positions of a full-time Community Manager and a part-time Executive Director were created. We are excited that Sophia Anyatonwu started on December 11, 2023 as our Community Manager and Sandra Gesing started on November 1, 2023 as our Executive Director.
* Three main activities and initiatives will be funded through the grant: The US-RSE Annual Conference, a Community Funds Program, and an Awards Program.
* Developing and maintaining a vibrant and functional community network requires infrastructure. To alleviate the struggles of the current process, we’ll invest in infrastructure for managing contact information for those in the network, facilitating networking opportunities between members, allowing people to choose their level of involvement in network activities, and communicating with members. 

## Community and Travel Funds program: Joint Mathematics Meetings 2024


Local RSEs met in early January for the "Reception for Mathematics Software Developers" at the American Mathematical Society's Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Francisco! The reception was made possible through our [Community and Travel Funds program](https://us-rse.org/grants-and-awards/).


Part of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant for US-RSE has been delegated for the Community and Travel Funds program. Members of US-RSE can apply for funds for community or individual purposes for event costs, get-togethers, travel funding, and more. Visit the webpage above for more details.

## User Experience Working Group 
The User Experience Working Group (UXWG) invites US-RSE members to join for its February meeting, *Getting to Know Each Other's Work: Show & Tell*.	This meeting will be on Feb 21st at 4:30 PM EST/3:30 PM CST/1:30 PM PT/2:30 PM MT.

For UXWG Members, this will be an opportunity for the broader community and your fellow working group members to have a window into the kinds of work you do and the problems you encounter. If UXWG members would like to participate in sharing, come prepared to spend five minutes discussing one particular project or activity you are working on (or have worked on in the recent past). You are encouraged to share something visual with the group (website, slide(s), mockups, etc.), but you are welcome to simply discuss your work too. Bloopers and successes are both great to share. This is intended to be an informal space so it's okay for your time to be unstructured! 

For US-RSE members, joining our meeting is a chance to get familiar with the kinds of issues user experience designers and researchers grapple with.  

The UXWG strives for regular, productive meetings that accommodate multiple schedules. We meet on the 3rd Tues of odd months at 2 PM ET/1 PM CST/11 AM PT/12 PM MT, and, on even months, the 3rd Wed at 4:30 PM ET/3:30 PM CST/1:30 PM PT/12 PM MT.

Next meeting: Feb 21, 4:30 PM Eastern

# **US-RSE Outreach**

The Outreach Working Group is actively recruiting new co-chairs to take over its leadership! Volunteers are also needed to help with organizing workshops, birds of a feather (BoF), symposiums, etc. Roles span from organizer to reviewer to speaker and more. Here are some key projects that recent co-chairs, Miranda Mundt and Josh Teves, have led to benefit the overall US-RSE community:
* Strategically planning and delivering the first-ever US-RSE conference in 2023
* Organizing the submission of collaborative proposals to relevant conferences
* Providing awesome SWAG to members
* Assisting the overall US-RSE community with delineating between membership, communications, and outreach efforts


If you are interested in contributing to a US-RSE hosted event, please reach out to the working group via the [#wg-outreach](https://app.slack.com/client/T8ZT4PJSW/CNR6E0N75) slack channel or [wg-outreach@us-rse.org](mailto:wg-outreach@us-rse.org).


<a name="financials"></a>
# **US-RSE Financials**

From a financial perspective, 2023 was an exciting year for US-RSE. We were awarded a two-year grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and switched fiscal sponsors. We are very grateful to the Open Collective Foundation (OCF) that was our fiscal sponsor until last spring. However, with the awarded grant our needs changed and we are now a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](https://communityinitiatives.org/) (CI). CI gives us the structure and resources to hire staff such as the Executive Director and the Community Manager, accept donations and reimburse members for expenses they incurred on behalf of US-RSE. The community funds possible via the Alfred P. Sloan grant are also awarded via CI.

The majority of the grant from the Sloan Foundation is budgeted to pay for our new Executive Director and Community Manager. Besides that we've budgeted money to support staff travel, the US-RSE conference, fund community activities through our new Community and Travel Fund program, and fund smaller items such as code of conduct trainings for our code of conduct committee members. CI charges 10% of our income for providing resources, infrastructure, and support (trust us when we say we make good use of those resources). Switching from OCF to CI turned out to been an unexpectedly complex change and it has been a very steep learning curve. We appreciate our members' patience as we navigate the world of non-profit regulations and guidelines.  



<a name="involved"></a>
# **Get Involved**

There are lots of ways to get involved with the US-RSE community. Of course, you can [join us on Slack](https://us-rse.org/join). We’re also looking for ideas and help in many other places. See our [list of projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjVD0WkeeWZJI6yqSKyMdIjtClzolsxv75RkpLju17I/edit?usp=sharing) and let us know how you’d like to help. Help with things like the Website Committee, Social Media, Community Engagement, Fundraising, and Newsletter are all needed and welcome.

New guidance was recently released on how to create new [Affinity Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-an-affinity-group) and [Working Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-a-working-group). If you see an unmet need in the US-RSE community, we encourage you to create your own group!
