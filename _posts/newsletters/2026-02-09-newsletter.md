🎵 Coders, it's cooooold outside in 2026 🎵

Here in the Northern hemisphere, especially for those of us in the East Coast of the US, an unprecedented
[Stratospheric Warming event](https://www.severe-weather.eu/global-weather/polar-vortex-collapse-february-2026-stratospheric-warming-forecast-winter-united-states-canada-europe-fa/) 
has been swelling over North America. What this means is that [Polar Vorteces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex), which is a term meteorological reporters
use to describe large waves of cold air, are repeatedly bearing down across the United States' East Coast. 
We hope that everyone is staying safe, warm, and doing what they can to make sure others in their community
are similarly safe and taken care of.

Meanwhile, trends in AI have been mixed so far this year, with a [recent article from Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2026/02/9-trends-shaping-work-in-2026-and-beyond) reporting
that AI layoffs are outpacing productivity gains, while proliferation of AI "workslop," a term for
poorly produced AI content, has begun clogging the productivity pipeline (who could have guessed🙄). One can only
speculate as to whether we'll ever find the "AI effectiveness sweetspot," between [uncannily heart-wrenching videos
of cats travelling the galaxy to save their family](https://youtube.com/shorts/wtqAxN6iYaw?si=-gvCozWfjW3fh1Ky), and 17-year-olds claiming to have found the
next solution to everyone's problem in a mobile app they vibe-coded in 5 hours ([and that inevitably
brings down an entire Firebase service overnight](https://thenewstack.io/vibe-coding-could-cause-catastrophic-explosions-in-2026/)).

Nevertheless, February is a month to celebrate, because it is **♠️Black History Month♠️!!**

# 🔔 **1. Black History Month**

Here at US-RSE, we maintain a strong dedication to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
(which you can read more about [here](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/)). We believe that a diversity 
of voices and opinions helps to improve our work and effectiveness as a community,
and that initiative includes dedicating time to recognize and celebrate the individuality and 
uniqueness of each of those voices and the groups they represent. If you are an African American,
black, mixed-race, or an African diaspora RSE, we are celebrating **YOU** this month and recognizing
not only _what_ you do for your organization and ours, but also _how_ you encourage and enable
others like you to pursue similar career goals, explicitly or implicitly.

Despite the many tragic and unspeakable horrors black and brown people have faced in
the United States and abroad over the centuries, and despite those almost certain to come,
**we are still here,** and we are participating, contributing, and 
leading in all aspects of business, technology, politics, entertainment,
and life at large.

**So we here at US-RSE want to wish you a safe and sound February and a Happy Black History Month.** While the
weather may beat us down this month, I encourage you all to keep striving, hoping, and persevering
as African Americans in tech have been doing for decades.

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
"It’s important to have as many voices as possible because inclusion really fuels innovation. If we want to see the best of the best in terms of technology, we need to make sure that voices that have been at the margins are really included."

### **Community Calls**

<!--Community call news goes here-->

On February 13th, the US-RSE community met yet again for a rousing
community call. The topic was **Web and Mobile Apps as Research Software**,
and stirred up so such conversation that the community decided to
start a brand new slack channel, #web-and-mobile-dev, to keep the
questions going. Check it out in Slack, as well as [this short slide
deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nVQgUiTXnB7_IXQ3IVA9DqrHgXTwEOGJ9Kgumy5v4YM/edit?slide=id.g3be9e8e9df9_0_33#slide=id.g3be9e8e9df9_0_33) from one of our speakers.

Our next meeting is scheduled 12:00-1:00PM ET on March 12th, 2026. We hope to see you there!

This RFI focuses on strengthening collaborations among national labs, universities, and industry; developing dual-competency AI degree programs; modernizing scientific curricula; and expanding institutional support such as data and compute resources. This is an opportunity for US-RSE to engage with federal decision-makers to ensure that academic data science — and research software engineering perspectives in general — serve a role in shaping national AI strategy. We invite members to share feedback on both the potential benefits of the Genesis Mission and the risks posed by insufficient academic resources. An upcoming workshop with AI, policy, and education leaders further underscores the importance of coordinated academic engagement.

As part of an international effort, US-RSE has worked with RSE organizations and leaders in other countries to develop the 2026 RSE Survey. You don’t need to be called an RSE to complete the survey. Your formal job title does not matter: we want to hear from you if you develop software for academic research as part of your work. The survey provides considerable detail about the RSE role: a person’s route into the role, the type of work they conduct, their working practices, job satisfaction and demographics. This means it takes around 20 minutes to complete. We appreciate that this is a significant amount of your time to donate - and we thank you for it!

We strongly encourage you to respond to the survey and to share it with others who may be interested. The results of this survey will be greatly beneficial to US-RSE as we move forward. The more responses we have, the better our knowledge.
