# 🔔 **1. US-RSE Conference 2025 (USRSE'25)**

Our third annual conference in Philadelphia was a huge success! We overcame a number of difficulties caused by the government shutdown, and had over 275 attendees from over 140 universities, national labs, companies, 
research institutes, and other organizations from all across the country, with an amazing array of talks, keynotes, posters, panels, workshops, and 
networking events. A huge thank you to all of you who attended, presented, volunteered, and sponsored the event.

We also had some wonderful feedback — attendees appreciated the diversity of topics and the quality of the presentations, with one attendee noting that it would take a natural disaster to keep them from coming back next year! Attendees particularly enjoyed Dr. Reed Maxwell's brilliant keynote, which gave us all a timely reminder of the importance of research software engineering in advancing science and society. In addition, participants found the community to be vibrant, welcoming, and kind:

> The conference brings together people from all different disciplines, domains, technologies, organizations, and walks of life. You *will* find someone you connect with. You *will* learn something new. And you *will* go back with a renewed enthusiasm for the work you do.

We truly hope you had a great time, made new connections, and learned new things. If you have any feedback or suggestions for future conferences, please don't hesitate to reach out to us on Slack!

You can find the full proceedings, including talks, posters, and panels, on the [Proceedings Page](https://zenodo.org/communities/usrse25/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest). Photographs from the event are still in the process of being vetted and will be shared soon.

**USRSE'25 was made possible thanks to our Platinum and Gold Conference Sponsors: Dell Technologies, SHI, Schmidt Sciences, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Princeton University, Globus, Los Alamos National Laboratory, IBM, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.**

You can volunteer for the planning committee at https://us-rse.org/usrse26/

Start working on those paper submissions for next year as well.  Expect the submission deadline to be in late Spring 2026.  Accepted full papers have a publication opportunity following the conference, so block off time on your calendar now to work on that write-up you've been putting off.

# 🛞 **3. Steering Committee Updates**

<!-- Fill in with current Steering Committee news -->

In October, the Steering Committee focused on the USRSE'25 Conference and community engagement initiatives. We conducted a thorough debrief with the conference chairs to assess what worked well and what needs improvement, and discussed strategies to secure more sponsors. We also outlined general planning timelines for future conferences and initiated an in-person discussion tradition during the conference. Additionally, we explored ways to make the processes related to our fiscal sponsorship work more smoothly.

The committee also began preparations for the upcoming International RSE Survey and discussed finalizing our own internal US-RSE annual survey. These surveys will provide valuable insights into the RSE community and help us steer our initiatives more effectively.

### Newsletter Cadence Update

Notice anything odd about the timing of this newsletter? We are shifting our newsletter cadence to release at the beginning of each month, rather than end-of-month. This will help us better align with other US-RSE administration teams and provide a more consistent schedule for our readers.

### **Community Calls**

<!--Community call news goes here-->

The next community call will be on Thursday, November 13, 2025, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT

**Topic: Show Me the Money (for Research Software Engineering)**

**Abstract:**

It’s no secret—funding for RSEs and RSE work can sometimes feel like hunting for treasure without a map. In this month’s community call, we’re diving into the big questions: How do you find funding? How do you actually secure it? And perhaps the trickiest part—how do you convince funders that your project (or your role as an RSE) is worth investing in?
But maybe grants aren’t the only answer. Are there other ways to keep a project alive and thriving? Have you found creative approaches to support your work when grants didn’t come through?
We’d love for you to bring your stories—both the epic wins and the “learning experiences” (aka not-so-successful applications). Come swap tips, share laughs, and pick up ideas from others who are navigating the same unpredictable funding waters.

    title="Open Innovation Sprint" 
    preamble="
Research software is the engine driving modern science and discovery. From analyzing complex datasets to simulating intricate phenomena, it's an indispensable part of the research lifecycle. Yet, understanding and quantifying its impact remains a significant challenge for researchers, project contributors, institutions, and funders alike.

How do we effectively measure the reach and influence of these vital tools? How can we incentivize better practices around software citation, metadata, and sustainability?

To tackle these shared ecosystem challenges head-on, [NumFOCUS’s](https://numfocus.org/) [Open Source Science Initiative](http://opensource.science/) launched the 2025 “Impact of Research Software” Open Innovation Sprint!

Running from March through late 2025, this sprint is a collaborative, fast-paced initiative bringing together researchers, engineers, designers, community organizers, and users. Our goal is to produce actionable, community-driven outputs – open source tools ready for immediate use and contribution.

This inaugural sprint, focused on measuring research software impact, is inspired by efforts such as the [CZI 2023 Software Impact Hackathon](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/software-impact-hackathon-2023), is led by NumFOCUS’s Open Source Science Initiative, and is made possible through collaboration with the [Research Software Alliance (ReSA)](https://www.researchsoft.org/), [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) and [ecosyste.ms](http://ecosyste.ms/), and the Sprint’s contributors and their organizations.
