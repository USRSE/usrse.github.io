# üëØ **2. Meetups! How RSE's Connect** üëØ

<!-- Add monthly theme / highlight -->
Meetups are a vital part of any community, and US-RSE is no exception. They provide a space for our members to connect, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. This month, we want to highlight some of the recent meetups that have taken place in our community.

## DMV Regional Group

The [DC/Maryland/Virginia Regional Group (RG-DMV)](https://us-rse.org/ag/dmv-rse/) hosts formal and informal gatherings every 2‚Äì3 months, offering professionals a chance to learn from and inspire each other. In January, they held a meetup focused on career development in research software engineering.

The event featured [Dr. Angeline Burrell](https://github.com/aburrell), a research physicist at the Naval Research Laboratory, who led a conversation on writing effective recommendation letters, publishing research code for impact, and incentivizing code and data sharing in grant applications ‚Äî and, of course, featured pizza!

{% include carousel.html height="45" unit="%" duration="10" number="1" %}

"A half-hour presentation led to about an hour of rich discussion and experience-sharing among RSEs from diverse research environments," said one attendee, summarizing the value of the event. "Just what this meetup is supposed to do!"

Between formal events, the [#rg-dmv-rse channel on Slack](https://us-rse.org/ag/dmv-rse/) can often be heard buzzing away actively as they plan, attend, and chat about in-person social events they host across the region.

## Indiana Regional Group

_But what if there's no meetup in my locale?_ you may be asking. Well, starting one himself is exactly what **Daniel Madren** did for local Hoosier-RSEs in the Indianapolis area. In April 2025, Daniel organized the first Indiana Regional Group meetup, bringing together RSEs from Indiana University, Purdue, and Notre Dame.

"We wanted to better understand how each of our teams operate," he said. "And how we might build something more intentional: a sustainable, connected US-RSE Indiana Regional Group."

{% include carousel.html height="45" unit="%" duration="10" number="2" %}

The group kicked off with introductions, then dove into a breakout session with sticky notes, easel pads, and big ideas for future networking strategies. Some ideas included regular meetups and knowledge-sharing events; establishing regional support networks; and emphasizing more in-person collaboration at existing conferences and symposiums.

Wondering how to get started? Daniel‚Äôs advice is to just start! ‚ÄúThe [US-RSE Community Funds program](https://us-rse.org/community-funds/) helps break down the barriers of institutional silos. [And,] because of the travel support, folks from Notre Dame and IU could take part in Purdue‚Äôs 2025 Research Computing Cyberinfrastructure Symposium, attend the RSE meetup, and build relationships all in one trip.‚Äù
By colocating events and taking initiative, the group maximized their time and laid the foundation for future collaboration on a modest budget.

üéâ Big thanks and congratulations to Daniel and the Indiana and DMV Regional Groups for sharing their stories! You can read Daniel's full report [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025-05-27-madren-community-travel-funds-report/). **Would you like to learn more about organizing a meetup?** Check out our [Forming US-RSE Affinity Groups](https://us-rse.org/wg/group-management/form-an-affinity-group) guide, and don‚Äôt miss the [Community Funds section](#community-funds) below to see how US-RSE can support your next event.

# üõû **3. Steering Committee Updates**

<!-- Fill in with current Steering Committee news -->

In May, the Steering Committee continued advancing priorities identified during our earlier strategic planning efforts. A newly formed subcommittee began reviewing Steering Committee eligibility criteria, election procedures, and the potential introduction of appointed roles to better support the evolving organization. With the changing federal funding and policy landscape affecting many RSEs, we also discussed whether and how US-RSE should respond, and what role we might play in supporting the community through these changes. Jointly with our Executive Director, we mapped out key initial tasks, goals, and priorities for a new Community Manager. Finally, we began early planning discussions for the USRSE‚Äô26 conference.

### **Community Calls**

<!--Community call news goes here-->

The next community call topic will be on **AI in Research Software Engineering** and will take place on June 13th at 1PM CDT/2PM EST. Please visit the [Community Calls Website](https://us-rse.org/events/category/#community-call) for more information and to access the registration link.

> It‚Äôs been almost two years since we lasted talked about AI, ChatGPT, and LLMs in RSEng, and a lot has changed in that time! Let‚Äôs get together and share how we‚Äôre using these tools today to write code, check code, or otherwise help out in our roles as RSEs. What do they mean for our job? How are they best deployed? Do they create trustworthy code? Or maybe you use them for research rather than for creating code for research? What do they mean for the next generation of research software engineers? These and so many more questions will be discussed at our next community call.

***May Community Call (Past)***   

The May Community Call was about the upcoming **USRSE'25 Conference**, and is available on YouTube:
