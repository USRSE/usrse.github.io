# **US-RSE Virtual Workshop 2022**
Following the success of the 2021 US-RSE Virtual Workshop, we decided to host another virtual event this year. The 2022 US-RSE Virtual Workshop will be held on two non-consecutive half days: September 14 and 16, 2022, 1-4pm ET/12-3pm CT/10am-1pm PT.

The theme of the workshop is “**Make it happen! Towards a diverse and sustainable future!**” The workshop will feature talks, and breakout group sessions. It will be held via Zoom and some parts, such as the talks, will be recorded and available after the workshop via the US-RSE YouTube channel. The workshop will be free but registration will be required.

Submission and application as reviewer deadline is July 17!

All information related to the workshop can be found on the [workshop website](https://us-rse.org/virtual-workshop-2022/).

# **US-RSE First Community Workshop**

Thanks to a generous grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, we held our first in-person US-RSE Association [Community Building Workshop](https://us-rse.org/first-community-workshop/), in Princeton, NJ on April 26-27, 2022. 50 attendees gathered to discuss and plan the best path forward to grow the US-RSE Association and develop the US RSE community. The workshop was a huge success! Multiple groups formed to work on producing outputs around topics ranging from Career Paths and Professional Development, Regional US-RSE Groups, Hiring RSEs, and much more. Read more about the specific topics and intended outputs in the [summary on the workshop website](https://us-rse.org/first-community-workshop/2022-05-13-workshop-summary/). Discussion are continuing on slack and there are plenty of opportunities to join in the conversation.

# **US-RSE Community Calls - NOTE NEW TIME**

**NEW TIME**

**NEW TIME**

**NEW TIME**

The USRSE monthly community calls are experimenting with a new time to try and better accommodate Alaska and Hawaii time zones. The calls are moving to the second Friday of each month. 14:00-15:00 Eastern starting June 2022. Community call topics, and agenda and zoom registration announcements are posted to Slack and sent to USRSE email lists.

The June 2022 (**on Friday June 9th, 14:00-15:00 US Eastern time**) call will focus on starting a whitepaper on the State of RSE in the US. The call will kickoff with a quick review of some of the recent community calls that touched on this topic. In breakout groups we will try and experiment with outlining a set of key sub-topics and the structure for a whitepaper. Look forward to seeing those of you who can make on the **Friday!!**

Community calls typically have a topical focus. They provide a forum for USRSE members to compare experiences around a topic, hang-out and chat on zoom. You can find the recordings of our monthly calls [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLMgG8jy8w-8neP6gPOgifH6kh4t_RUTTH).

Interested in suggesting a topic or leading a community call?  We meet two weeks prior to each community call to decide on a topic and discuss how to structure the call. Anyone is welcome to join the preparation call on [Zoom](https://mit.zoom.us/j/93471607274?pwd=aXUzNzZsWElpWnc4N2NXaWxOcVNlQT09).

# **Data Scientist/RSE Academic Career Support Workshop**

The Academic Data Science Alliance (ADSA) and US-RSE are hosting an in-person 2-day [workshop](https://academicdatascience.org/adsa-meetings/2022-fall-workshop) on October 24-25, 2022 in Chicago focused on elucidating best practices for recruitment, career development, and retention of staff data scientists and research software engineers in academic settings. The primary outcome of this workshop will be a guide book that addresses how data scientists, research software engineers, hiring managers, and administrators can successfully create rewarding career paths for these new types of positions.  Participants will be expected to actively engage in content creation throughout the workshop and participate in writing, review, and editing of the end product(s) after the workshop has concluded.  If you are interested in participating in this workshop, please use [this form](https://form.jotform.com/221427005930042) to tell us a little about yourself and your interest and expertise in this area. Applications should be submitted by June 15, 2022.

# **US-RSE at PEARC22**

If you'll be attending [PEARC22](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc22/), US-RSE members and friends will be hosting a panel titled *Building Enduring Cyberinfrastructures - The Role of Professional Research Software Engineers*. The panel will feature speakers from several software centric cyberinfrastructure initiatives and will be a participatory forum for a discussion on topics around how to sustain and grow such efforts. The date and time of the panel has not been announced by the PEARC organizers yet. If the panel fits in your schedule we would love to see you there and will have US-RSE stickers for everyone!!

# **Community News**

* A [survey of the state of the practice for research software in the United States](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.963) presents findings from a survey of 1,149 researchers, primarily from the United States, about sustainability challenges they face in developing and using research software.
* The [FAIR4RS Working Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-4-research-software-fair4rs-wg) has released a [survey on the FAIR4RS adoption guidelines](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6374598) already available, which lists more than 30 guidelines/tools. This will assist in implementation of [version 1.0 of the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles)](https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068). Another [FAIR4RS report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6258366) provides examples of adoption of the FAIR4RS Principles by a range of organisations.

# **US-RSE Outreach**

Upcoming Outreach opportunities with US-RSE:

* We submitted a proposal for a [Birds of a Feather session at SciPy 2022](https://www.scipy2022.scipy.org/bof-sessions) about US-RSE. This will be a moderated panel discussion.
* The [Research Software Engineers in eScience workshop](https://us-rse.org/rse-escience-2022/) will take place as part of eScience 2022, Salt Lake City, Utah, October 11-14, 2022. This workshop will present RSE contributions to scientific research through a series of talks that explore scientific project needs, how access to RSEs made the project successful, and how this work can be applied to future scientific research efforts. The workshop will be of interest to existing RSEs, potential RSEs, domain scientists, and software developers who want to understand the lessons from both good and bad research software engineering experiences.
Submissions of abstracts and short papers (not part of the proceedings) are open until July 11!

# **New groups**

The new financial sustainability working group is moving forward. The goal of this group will be to examine and develop a range of ideas to move US-RSE to a stable financial model. Please feel free to reach out to Chris Hill if you are interested in participating in this working group. The group will meet at least monthly and will look at everything from sponsorship, individual and institutional membership models, more logo items, philanthropic partners and beyond!

A draft write-up of financial sustainability discussions from the Princeton community building workshop is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16JtwhNIX4gKc1qDmcgD7qdOqYE2MUwRANtdAsXUfsFQ). The discussions span everything from membership fees and sponsors to plans for logo items. If you have thoughts on these or other financial sustainability topics please feel free to join in discussions in the working group slack channel [#wg-financial-sustainability](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C03BBT8FXFY).

The working group on regional and local RSE groups starts to reach out to different regional groups and is working on creating a document with plans and tips. If you are interested, have a look at the regional channels and the [Slack post](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C8ZB01CGH/p1652658941234569) whether we overlooked a regional group or whether there is interest to join or create a new one.
