including self-nominations, [for the US-RSE Steering Committee
election](https://us-rse.org/about/election/) are now open. Nominations are due
November 5, 2021.

Interested members are encouraged to [nominate
themselves](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoLAWkUqsv7axDFnaV3GEw0gRBDemqSztbxKTtGr7EE1rWqA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Alternatively, if you know of a member who you think would make a good
candidate, you can [submit a nomination for someone
else](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoLAWkUqsv7axDFnaV3GEw0gRBDemqSztbxKTtGr7EE1rWqA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
All US-RSE members in good standing as of October 22, 2021 (when
nominations are opened) are eligible to be nominated as candidates.

Steering Committee members are elected by the general US-RSE membership to a
2-year term. To provide continuity, Steering Committee members have staggered
terms, with four or five members elected each year. Last year we held our first
elections for four Steering Committee seats. This year, there are five seats up
for election. The following steering committee members have terms that end this
year: Jeff Carver, Ian Cosden, Charles Ferenbaugh, Sandra Gesing, and
Christina Maimone. The election will take place from December 3rd to
December 10th, 2021, after the Annual General Meeting.

On the [nomination
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoLAWkUqsv7axDFnaV3GEw0gRBDemqSztbxKTtGr7EE1rWqA/viewform?usp=sf_link),
