Dear US-RSE Members and Allies,

As we reach the end of 2025, I am grateful for the strength, generosity, and momentum of the US-RSE community. Now numbering over 3,700 members, this community continues to show that progress is built through collaboration, care, and a shared commitment to improving research through better software. This year reminded many of us that progress can be challenging under uncertainty, and the community continued to show up for each other with practical help, thoughtful questions, and steady engagement.

One of the key milestones this year has been the formation and engagement of our Organizational Founding Members. Your partnership is helping US-RSE grow from a strong grassroots network into a durable, long-term organization, while remaining firmly rooted in its community. This growth strengthens our ability to serve members, expand programming, and elevate research software engineering across institutions, disciplines, and career stages.

We are also deeply grateful for the continued support of major funding partners, including the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and Schmidt Sciences. Their sustained investment has been critical in enabling US-RSE to grow its capacity, strengthen its operations, and support the community in meaningful ways.

Our sense of community was especially evident at the US-RSE conference in Philadelphia, which brought together more than 280 participants for conversations, knowledge sharing, and connections across institutions and career stages. The energy, openness, and generosity of that gathering reflected the best of what US-RSE stands for and continues to motivate our work throughout the year.

I also want to express my sincere thanks to our Steering Committee. Your time, care, and leadership continue to shape US-RSE in ways that members can feel. This includes governance, strategic direction, and thoughtful decision-making, as well as providing stability and clarity when it is most needed. I am also grateful to the many volunteers and working group contributors whose time and expertise quietly power much of what US-RSE is able to do.

Community building and education continue to be core parts of our work, among several areas of focus. One highlight this year was our webinar series with Reach The World, designed for K12 classrooms to introduce students to supercomputing, research software, and the future of AI. These sessions reached over 900 students across 46 classrooms, with continued engagement through more than 1,390 YouTube views. Seeing young learners connect with research software concepts reinforces why visibility, outreach, and clear pathways into our field matter so much.

Looking ahead, we will continue focusing on career recognition, strengthening partnerships, and sustainable growth, while staying grounded in what this community needs most. This includes connection, practical resources, and a strong sense of belonging for RSEs wherever they are. I am excited about what we will build together in 2026 and deeply thankful to everyone who contributed time, ideas, encouragement, and energy this year. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I value your ideas, questions, and feedback, and I am always glad to hear from you.

Wishing you a restful holiday season and a happy, healthy New Year.

Warm regards,
Sandra Gesing
Executive Director, US-RSE
