The [election period for the US-RSE Steering
Committee](https://us-rse.org/about/election/) has ended. 61 US-RSE members
voted in the election.

Weâ€™re excited to announce that the following five US-RSE members have been
selected to serve on the committee for the term 2022-2023:

* Nicole Brewer
* Jeffrey Carver
* Ian Cosden
* Sandra Gesing
* Christina Maimone

A big thanks to Charles Ferenbaugh, Rinku Gupta, and Chen Zhang for making the
election competitive, and thanks to everyone who voted for participating!

A huge thanks as well to Charles Ferenbaugh, member of our founding [Steering
Committee](https://us-rse.org/steering-committee/), for his service to US-RSE,
which we hope will continue in other ways.
