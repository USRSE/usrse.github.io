We are excited to announce that the US-RSE Association will host a virtual workshop on April 22 and 23, 2020!  

This workshop will be held in three online sessions:
1. **The RSE Landscape** - Reports on RSE groups and activities, with discussion (Wednesday 4/22, 12:00-1:30 PM EDT)
1. **Technical talks** - Short talks about projects that RSEs are working on (Wednesday 4/22, 3:00-4:30 PM EDT)
1. **Next steps for the US-RSE organization** - Breakout sessions to discuss ideas. What do *you* want from US-RSE? (Thursday 4/23, 12:00-1:30 PM EDT)

A detailed agenda is in the works and will be posted online when ready.

The workshop is free, but we ask that all participants preregister so that we know how many to expect and can prepare appropriately. The registration form will be posted soon.

The sessions will be held using Zoom.  Connection information will be sent to registered participants before the workshop.
(We've seen the recent news about Zoom security issues, and we will be taking appropriate security precautions.)
