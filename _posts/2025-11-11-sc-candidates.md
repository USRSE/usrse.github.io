**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**<br>
I want to continue on the Steering Committee (SC) because I believe in the work US-RSE does in building community for research software engineers and promoting the role of RSE, and I'd like to stay involved in these efforts. I've found US-RSE to be an extremely supportive community of people who understand the challenges and rewards of working in research software. I think it's critical that we maintain this welcoming nature while continuing to grow the community.

In addition, being a part of the SC for the past two years has shown me that much more goes into running US-RSE than I realized. I've made an effort to document the behind-the scenes tasks that our SC members and other volunteers do, as well as the systems and processes we rely on, in an attempt to give US-RSE as an organization the same level of reliability and resiliency we would hope for in our research code. While this has improved, there is more to be done, and I would like the opportunity to see it through.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**<br>
I've been the Deputy Treasurer of the SC for the past two years, learning about the finances of the organization and supporting the Treasurer in her work. I've also been a Sponsorship Chair for the past two US-RSE conferences, where I helped raise funds and coordinate finances for the conference. In addition, I'm actively involved in the US-RSE community, serving as the co-chair of the Community Calls Working Group, which aims to promote connections among RSEs by organizing monthly virtual calls on a variety of topics. I'm also a co-chair of the Code Review Working Group, which focuses on providing resources and events related to code review. 

In my day-to-day work as the technical lead of an RSE group, I attempt to promote good software development practices within my group, and being a part of the US-RSE community is a great help in this. I've found the slack channel, community calls, and various working groups to be amazing resources to gain new insights and information, and I try to share back what I've learned and what's worked for me and my group in these platforms in the hopes that they can help others as well.

[Email](mailto:akoufos@sun.stanford.edu), [Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexkoufos/)

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**<br>
I'm enthusiastic about Research Software Engineering because I truly believe RSEs are the essential piece for turning good research into great science.

When I finished my degree in late 2014, I already felt drawn to RSE work, albeit the term wasn't common in the U.S. at the time. My job search led me to a position developing 3-D visual simulations for training, which sharpened my software-engineering skills but left my scientific curiosity wanting.

Moving to Stanford let me combine those skills with robotics research, where I fortunately encountered the US-RSE. Here, I found an amazing community where nearly all my interested aligned.

During the past two years as a Steering Committee member, I've helped connect the Stanford RSEs with the local community and have brought more scientists into the conversation through my existing collaborations. I'd like to continue building that bridge, promote the RSE role, and make it easier for others to pursue a career in this amazing field.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**<br>
I've been involved with the US-RSE for roughly five years now, and in that time I've tried to turn my enthusiasm for RSEng into actions.

### Community leadership
- Co-chair of several US-RSE groups: the Bay Area Regional Group, the Code Review Working Group, the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) Working Group, and the Institutional RSE Networking Affinity Group.
- Local US-RSE representative for multiple RSE-focused initiatives on Stanford's campus, linking the university with the broader association.

### Programmatic contributions
- Helped shape the DEI mission statement and organized DEI-oriented events that highlight inclusive practices in RSEng.
- Contributed to website content and design to make information easy for newcomers.
- Presented at RSE and scientific conferences, as well as events hosted by communities of practice, e.g. PyHC, promoting the RSE role and better practices through talks, papers, and collaborations.

### Future focus
- Partnering with Keith Beattie to host USRSE'26 in the SF Bay Area.
- Collaborating with Stanford faculty and staff to formalize the RSE position as an official role on campus, creating a sustainable career path for future RSEs.

Through these activities, and more, I aim to keep the US-RSE visible, inclusive, and usefulÑespecially for researchers who haven't yet heard the term RSE. By connecting people, improving resources, and advocating for institutional recognition, I hope to strengthen the community for years to come.

I believe the US-RSE has a unique opportunity to expand beyond academia, embracing engineers and leaders from industry who share the same passion for sustainable, research-driven software.
As a Steering Committee member, I hope to contribute strategic thinking, technical depth, and a global perspective—while fostering inclusion, mentorship, and collaboration across sectors.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**<br>
My contribution to the broader RSE community comes from building and connecting ecosystems that unite research, engineering, and people (I am people oriented).
At Nubank, I led organizations focused on essential platforms (high scalability), AI enablement, and data infrastructure that serve tens of millions of users. These initiatives advance many of the same principles valued by the RSE community: reproducibility, scalability, and research-informed software design.
Previously, at Globo.com, I was manager at Big Data & AI division—creating ML Ops and recommendation, experimentation platforms that bridged academic research with real-world impact. This experience shaped my view that software engineering and scientific research are not separate disciplines but parts of the same creative continuum.
Beyond technical work, I'm deeply committed to mentorship and inclusion. I've coached engineers transitioning from QA to full-stack, mentored women in tech, and supported open conversations on diversity and leadership in AI.
Through these efforts, I aim to make the RSE community more global, connected, and inclusive—ensuring that research software thrives not just in labs, but in every environment where knowledge and technology meet.

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**<br>
I've been deeply involved with US-RSE since a few of us first got it off the ground, and have proudly served as Chair of the Steering Committee since its inception in 2019. Over the past few years, we've grown from an all-volunteer effort with virtually no funding to a nationally visible organization with paid staff, expanded programming (including a conference!), and a growing advocacy presence. US-RSE is at an inflection point in its maturity, and we must grow and adapt to sustain our offerings without losing our grassroots character and community-first approach. I want to continue building on our momentum by planning for long-term financial sustainability, ensuring the long-term viability of our conference series, supporting our incredible volunteers, and expanding our advocacy efforts. I remain as committed as ever to US-RSE's mission and will work to ensure our community-first spirit thrives as we grow and solidify US-RSE's role as a fixture in the national research ecosystem.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**<br>
I was one of the founding members of US-RSE and have had the privilege of serving as Chair of the Steering Committee (SC) since its formation in 2019. Early on, I led the drafting of the US-RSE mission statement and have since contributed to nearly every aspect of the organization. I've organized and participated in panels and workshops, led the 2022 US-RSE Community Building Workshop, and served as PI on the $800k Sloan Foundation grant that enabled US-RSE to hire staff, launch new initiatives, and kickstarted the conference series. I've also overseen our transition to a new fiscal sponsor, serving in a fiduciary role and as volunteer Project Director prior to hiring our Executive Director (ED).
I continue to partner with our ED and SC to keep US-RSE financially sustainable and operational, and I also handle many of the behind-the-scenes tasks that keep the organization running. I advise our conference organizers, actively participate in multiple working and affinity groups, and regularly engage with community calls, events, and newsletters to keep members informed and connected.
I'm currently the Senior Director of Research Software Engineering at Princeton University. Over the last ten years I've grown our central RSE team from one to 39 RSEs, and regularly use this platform as a way to advocate for the role and impact of RSEs in research. Whenever and wherever possible I'm eager to share lessons learned and promote the RSE role through talks, papers, and community events.

## Keith Beattie

[Email](mailto:KSBeattie@lbl.gov), [Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ksbeattie/)

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**<br>
As a current member of the US-RSE Steering Committee, a manager of RSEs and someone who has worked as an RSE, in both industry and for the last 20+ years at a national lab, I would very much like to continue to have an active impact on how scientific software is perceived and further support the careers of RSEs by being elected to another term on the US-RSE Steering Committee.

After spending 5 years as a software and release engineer in industry then coming LBL as a Computer Systems Engineer (CSE), I was struck by the lack of rigor in how scientific software is developed and the difference in status between those on the Scientist career track vs those on CSE track. 20 years on, I now have deep experience and insights on how things can change so that scientific software, and those who develop it can become first-class citizens within the scientific community. I would like to continue to apply that experience in supporting RSEs by serving another term on the US-RSE Steering Committee.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**<br>
I currently serve on the US-RSE Steering Committee participating in discussions and decisions on the direction and management of the organization. Last year I served as one of the Steering Committee election co-chairs overseeing the election of last year's co-hort of Steering Committee members, currently am one of the International Council Representatives participating in discussions and activities with RSE organizations across the world, and this year I am one of the General Co-Chairs for the upcoming USRSE'26 Conference in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Advocating for RSEs has been a passion of mine long before the RSE term existed. Having long challenged my co-workers on the way scientific software is developed and how those who build and maintain it are not seen as equal partners in the research mission, I am now at a point in my career where I can apply my experiences and take greater risks in supporting RSEs than I have previously been able to. To that end, I now lead a group of RSEs at LBL and a local, albeit informal LBL-RSE effort doing at the single lab-level what the US-RSE does for the RSEs across the country. This year I was able to get LBL to become a founding organizational member of the US-RSE at the premier level for 5 years. Continuing in that supportive spirit, I plan on bringing an experienced perspective to the organization on how we can best support RSE as currently described in our mission statement.
