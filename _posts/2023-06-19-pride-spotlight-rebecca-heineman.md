US-RSE's [DEI working group (DEI-WG)](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/) is proud to
help US-RSE celebrate and participate in [Pride
Month](https://www.loc.gov/lgbt-pride-month/). Each week during Pride Month,
the US-RSE will spotlight a member of the LGBTQIA+ community who has been
involved in computing, science, engineering, and/or math, and have inspired our
members through their accomplishments in their careers and their personal
stories.

## This week’s Pride Month spotlight features Rebecca Heineman

It’s easy to overlook the breadth of skill involved in creating a video game,
but any study of game design will quickly change your mind. Sitting at the
intersection of art, physics, storytelling, and (of course) computers, video
game creation is complex and I can’t help but marvel at those who can
successfully navigate its [pitfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall!)s
(pun definitely intended). As Research Software Engineers, we leverage many of
the same skills and it’s important to celebrate and support each other. As we
highlight LGBTQIA+ individuals this month, I’d like to introduce you to someone
who has been around games since the 80s.

Rebecca Heineman is a video game enthusiast and champion (at [Space
Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)) turned programmer and
game designer. Also known by the pseudonym Burger, she worked on countless
games such as [The Bard's
Tale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bard%27s_Tale_(1985_video_game)),
[Wasteland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)), and various
other ports (which could be particularly challenging due to hardware
limitations and incompatibilities), perhaps most famously as a co-founder of
[Interplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplay_Entertainment). Later in
her career, she spent time consulting with Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Microsoft,
Sony, Bloomberg, and Amazon; additionally, she founded Olde Sküül, her current
company, in 2013. Rebecca also served as a board member of GLAAD and is a
member of the International Video Game Hall of Fame (Class of 2017). I’m happy
to (briefly) share her story here and I encourage you to learn more about her
and LGBTQIA+ influence in the history of gaming and computers!
