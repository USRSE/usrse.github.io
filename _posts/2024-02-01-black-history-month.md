US-RSE's [DEI working group (DEI-WG)](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/) is proud to
help US-RSE celebrate and participate in [Black History
Month](https://www.blackhistorymonth.gov/).

Throughout the month US-RSE members will be sharing stories that recognize and
celebrate inspirational African Americans who have been involved in computing,
science, engineering, and/or math, and have inspired our members through their
accomplishments in their careers and their personal stories. We'll be
publishing these posts throughout February to highlight such people, where we
talk about the person and tie their work and life to the RSE movement.

Weâ€™d also like to bring to your attention some resources for learning about
Black history in tech:
