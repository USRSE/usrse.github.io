We're excited to announce the results of our first [Steering Committee Election](https://us-rse.org/2020-09-29-sc-election-announce/).  78 US-RSE members voted in the election.  

The following candidates have been elected to a two-year term, January 2021 - December 2022.  

* Julia Damerow, Arizona State University
* Daniel S. Katz, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
* Lance Parsons, Princeton University
* Chris Hill, MIT

Thanks to Zhiyong Zhang and Gregory Watson for making the election competitive, and thanks to everyone who voted for participating.  We're looking forward to continued growth of the US-RSE in the coming year, with more exciting events and community-initiated activities.  

A huge thanks as well to Jordan Perr-Sauer, member of our founding [Steering Committee](https://us-rse.org/steering-committee/), for his service to US-RSE.
