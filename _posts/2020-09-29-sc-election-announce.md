A membership verification email will be sent to all members in early October, by October 9, 2020.

Individuals who do not receive the membership verification email by October 10, 2020, may join the organization by filling out the membership form at [https://us-rse.org/join/](https://us-rse.org/join/).  For questions or help with membership matters, please contact Election Chair Christina Maimone on Slack or [via email](mailto:christina.maimone@northwestern.edu).

The US-RSE Steering Committee sets its own meeting frequency and timing.  Currently, the Steering Committee is meeting every two weeks.  The Steering Committee meeting frequency and schedule for 2021 will be determined once new members are elected.

## Voting

Elections will be run through https://electionbuddy.com.  US-RSE members' email addresses will be shared with this site for the sole purpose of voting.  Each US-RSE member as of the day before the voting period opens, December 12, 2020, gets one ballot with the voting rule of [single transferable vote (STV)](https://electionbuddy.com/features/voting-systems/stv-voting).  This voting rule asks each voter to rank the candidates, and seats are allocated across candidates using this ranking information.  

The results of the election are valid regardless of the turnout rate for the election.
