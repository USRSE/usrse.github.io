As part of an international effort, the US-RSE has worked with RSE organizations in other countries to develop the 2021 RSE Survey. 
You don’t need to be called an RSE to complete the survey.
Your formal job title does not matter: we want to hear from you if you develop software for academic research as part of your work.
The survey provides considerable detail about the RSE role: a person’s route into the role, the type of work they conduct, their working practices, job satisfaction and demographics.
This means it takes around 20 minutes to complete.
We appreciate that this is a significant amount of your time to donate - and we thank you for it! 

We strongly encourage you to respond to the survey and to share it with others who may be interested.
The results of this survey will be greatly beneficial to US-RSE as we move forward.
The more responses we have, the better our knowledge.
