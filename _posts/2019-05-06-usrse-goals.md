The US-RSE Association is centered around three main goals.  Moving
forward we aim to target our activities and actions to serving these
three main goals. Over time we plan to revist and refine these goals as
the needs and desires of the community change.



## Community 

  We seek to provide a coherent association of those who identify with
  the role (not necessarily title) of Research Software Engineer based
  on our [inclusive definition]({{site.url}}/what-is-an-rse).  This group aims to provide the members
  of the community the ability to share knowledge, professional
  connections, and resources.

## Advocacy 

  We aim to promote RSEs impact on research, highlighting the
  increasingly critical and valuable role RSEs serve.

## Resources 

  We strive to provide useful resources to multiple demographics.
  For current and future RSEs we strive to provide technical and
  career development resources to support their professional
  development.  We aim to provide access to information and material
  to support the establishment and expansion of RSE positions and
  groups within the research ecosystem including the material for
  making business justifications for RSEs.
