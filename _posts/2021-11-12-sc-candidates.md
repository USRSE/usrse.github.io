**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

US-RSE has given me the language and community to understand my job as a step
in a long career. I'd like to use my experience as an early-career woman to
amplify my and other's unique perspectives on this career path. In particular,
I'd like to make the career and the people in it more visible in order to wear
in more pathways into this field.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

I'm an active participant in the DEI discussion groups since it's inception
last year, where I have had a significant role in putting on many events,
including the first book club, and several speaker series events. I'm a proud
contributor to the diversity and inclusion statement. My next effort will be to
cross-list several of my Women in HPC podcast episodes with RSE Stories. To V's
credit, RSE Stories was my gateway into understanding many of the major
outstanding issues in this field, and what careers in research software
engineering can look like, now and into the future. I look forward to bringing
that kind of clarity and sense of belonging to the next person.

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

My experience on the US-RSE Steering Committee (SC) and my research interests
motivate my interest to serve another term. As a founding member of the US-RSE
SC, I have enjoyed the opportunity to contribute to the direction of US-RSE. My
experience serving on steering committees for other organizations has allowed
me to guide organizations in positive directions. One of the roles of an SC
member is to help the organization make positive changes by identifying
internal blind spots and external developments to help the organization respond
to them, which I enjoy doing. Additionally, my key academic research interests
focus on the development of research software and the people involved in the
process. In my role as a Professor of Computer Science focused on Software
Engineering, I conduct research to understand and advance the field of research
software and research software engineering. I would like to use this research
background to help shape the direction of US-RSE.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

As a member of the US-RSE Steering Committee (SC) since its founding in 2019, I
have taken on four active roles. First, I have led the US-RSE Education &
Training Working group. This group has developed a list of existing RSE
training resources, identified a list of the types of skills RSEs may possess,
and created a list of RSE archetypes. Together these resources position this
group to work towards outcomes like the design of certificates and/or templates
for RSE degrees. Second, this year I have served as the SC Secretary. In this
role, I helped with event logistics and have edited and posted event
videos, including community calls, to the US-RSE YouTube channel. Third, I
worked with two other SC members to obtain Sloan Foundation funding to
support a US-RSE Community Building Workshop, scheduled for Spring 2022.
Fourth, I have co-led the US-RSE involvement in the International RSE
survey where I have helped ensure the survey questions gather information
helpful to advance US-RSE. Beyond these specific service roles for US-RSE,
in my work as a Professor of Computer Science, I conduct and publish
research on the people and processes involved in developing research
software. I anticipate my future research will continue to focus on
important questions related to RSEs and research software. This expertise
in software engineering and its application to research software provides
an important perspective to the RSE community at large and specifically to
US-RSE SC decisions.

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

When I was in grad school (Mech Eng) I discovered I liked programming more
than science. I had envisioned working in an RSE-like role, though at the time,
I had no idea it could be an actual thing. I saw the need from the research
side and the potential impact, but I felt I had to create it myself. Now, years
later, I want to hold the door open for others. I want to make RSEs a
first-class member of the research community. RSEs should have stable funding,
long-term career opportunities, and be treated as valued collaborators. RSEs
are crucial to the long-term sustainability and performance of research
software and funders, institutions, and organizations should support them
accordingly.

I believe wholeheartedly in US-RSE’s mission and that our collective power has
the ability to positively influence the RSE profession in countless ways. I’m
fully committed to US-RSE and, if elected, will focus on driving its growth in
membership, diversity, influence, and effectiveness.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

I was one of the founding members of US-RSE. In the early days of US-RSE, I led
the community drafting of the US-RSE mission statement. I’ve been serving as
the inaugural chair of the steering committee. I’ve spearheaded, organized, and
participated in multiple US-RSE
[panels](https://academicdatascience.org/cdn/early-career-panel) and
[workshops](https://us-rse.org/events/2020/2020-04-virtual-workshop/). I’ve
written [blog
posts](https://urssi.us/blog/2019/04/16/why-research-software-engineers/) and
co-authored
[articles](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/us-rse-supporting-the-research-software-engineer),
[papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01880v1), and
[presentations](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=109617) promoting
RSEs. I’m the lead PI (along with Co-PIs Jeff Carver and Dan Katz) on a Sloan
Foundation [grant](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/9227) to host a [US-RSE
workshop](https://us-rse.org/first-community-workshop/) at Princeton
(rescheduled to April ‘22). I’ve been active in the initial development and
redesign of the US-RSE website. I do all this in an effort to build an RSE
community in the US that can become self-sustaining. I’m committed to the
success of US-RSE and I believe we are stronger and better together. A cohesive
and connected community can drive progress and influence change in ways
individuals can’t. Advocacy for one is advocacy for all.

Last year I
[co-founded](https://researchsoftware.org/2021/01/27/introducing-the-international-council-of-RSE-associations.html)
the [International Council of RSE
Associations](https://researchsoftware.org/council.html), an organization of
leaders from the various national RSE associations to foster collaboration and
communication amongst our communities.  In my day job as Director of Research
Software Engineering for Computational & Data Science at Princeton University,
I’ve built a [centralized RSE
group](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/services/research-software-engineering)
from a single RSE in 2016 to a team of 12 full-time RSEs. I actively use this
as a platform to advertise RSEs’ impact on research and advocate for RSEs both
locally and in the broader community.

[Email](mailto:cferenba@lanl.gov), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-ferenbaugh-b2822a225/)

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

I have been doing RSE-type work for over 25 years, first in industry and then
at Los Alamos National Lab.  Like many RSEs, I've often struggled to build a
career and get recognition for software contributions to domain science code
projects.  When I learned of the RSE Association in the UK several years ago, I
was excited and encouraged, and I wanted to see something similar start in the
US to support RSEs and their work in this country.  I've been fortunate to be
able to help get US-RSE going, and I want to continue in that work. 

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

I've been interested in software engineering and software quality for many
years, and I've participated in a number of DOE workshops and activities on
these topics over the past decade.  I've supported improvements in the software
culture at LANL over two decades, particularly working with code projects
wanting to modernize their code bases to use exascale computing effectively.
I've tried to build bridges between domain scientists and computer
scientists/RSEs at LANL and in the wider community, since I've had a foot in
both camps myself.  I was an early member of US-RSE and a founding Steering
Committee member.  I've been involved in a number of US-RSE-sponsored events,
and I organized the first US-RSE virtual workshop in April 2020.  I've also
been the lead organizer of the “Research Software Engineers in HPC” workshops
at SC20 and SC21.

## Sandra Gesing

[Email](mailto:sandra.gesing@nd.edu), [Website](http://sandra-gesing.com/)

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

I am passionate about improving career paths for RSEs and for incentivizing
their work via means beyond the traditional academic rewarding system. While
there is rising awareness of the importance of people in this line of work and
of research software, we still have a long way to go to reach all crucial
communities to achieve a cultural change in academia. I like the
community-driven model we created with the current steering committee with
working groups, monthly community calls, yearly workshops and the different
types of outreach and communication channels. It is exciting to see the growth
of the community in the last two years and to be part of a world-wide movement
with the RSE Society in the UK and international associations all over the
world. I would like to continue to actively advocate for RSEs and foster the
growth of the community exploring additional venues and ways for outreach and
take responsibility for tasks such as the newsletters and/or leading a working
group.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

I am the current co-chair of the founding steering committee of US-RSE and I am
a senior scientist at the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) at the University
of Illinois Chicago. One of the focus areas of my research is sustainability of
research software. I was one of the Co-PIs of the conceptualization of the US
Research Software Sustainability Institute and we work on further funding and
the vision for this institute. I am also a Co-PI of the Science Gateways
Community Institute and the project “Coordinating Curricula and User
Preferences to Maximize the Participation of Women and Students of Color in
Engineering”. When I came to the US eight years ago, I worked first as an RSE.
After a few months I switched to a research faculty position collaborating with
a team of RSEs at the University of Notre Dame supporting the growth of the
team by including them in my projects. I just changed jobs in July to DPI and
I’m the scientific outreach and DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) lead. One
of my goals in this position is to build a team of RSEs at DPI, connect
students with companies and start-ups in STEM and create a welcoming thriving
working environment. Another goal is to build a local “Midwest” RSE hub in
Chicago with regular meetings/small events. That could be coming together for a
virtual US-RSE community call and extending the meeting afterwards with local
discussions or other activities when everyone feels more comfortable again with
meeting in person.

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

As a research software engineer (RSE) for over two decades, working in a DOE
lab environment as well as in industry and academia, I bring insight and
solutions to challenges faced by RSEs in scientific computing environments. The
RSE community is united based on the commonalities of the work we do, whether
in academia, industry or national laboratories. However, career trajectories,
professional connections, technical resources, and career development
opportunities differ significantly in these working environments. If elected to
the US-RSE steering committee, I would work with fellow committee members and
the RSE community to advance the RSE cause, as well as to address issues in
diversity, equality and inclusion, and to promote the importance of fully
supporting the careers of RSEs.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

My two-decade background as an RSE makes me passionate about advancing the RSE
movement. Some of this passion is reflected in organizing RSE-focused events in
the scientific community, representing Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) at
domestic/international RSE events, and establishing collaborations with other
RSE organizations such as the UK’s Software Sustainability Institute. I have
also  been a  part of the RSE-HPC workshop program committee, working toward
its promotion and success.  As editor-in-chief of the Better Scientific
Software website [https://bssw.io](https://bssw.io), a central hub for sharing
information about scientific software productivity and sustainability, I am
enthusiastic about disseminating knowledge that helps in the development and
enrichment of  RSEs and their teams. Over the last year, I have been advancing
the RSE movement in DOE laboratories. In early 2021, I started a grass-roots
movement for empowerment of RSEs at ANL, with emphasis on promoting
interactions among RSEs across various divisions at ANL and disseminating
information about the RSE movement. The first ANL RSE meet-n-greet session in
mid-2021 was attended by over 50 RSEs at ANL.  My article “Understanding the
Manifold Gap for RSE Recognition in National Laboratories” is being used to
push forward lab discussions about the importance of fully supporting the
careers of RSEs in DOE labs. I am eager to continue working closely with the
US-RSE community for RSE empowerment.

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

I want to continue the work we've started to build US-RSE from a group on
Slack into an organization that can sustain itself into the future.  All of the
impactful things we'd like US-RSE to do -- recognition for RSEs,
professionalization of RSE roles, creation of RSE groups at universities and
research institutes, RSE training -- rely on US-RSE being able to operate and
continue to connect RSEs.  To do this, we need to broaden engagement, develop a
plan to support US-RSE financially, and then develop systems to support routine
operations, such as managing membership and communications.

I work at the intersection of data science and research software engineering,
supporting researchers with a broad range of challenges.  I want to continue to
represent data scientists who also identify as RSEs within US-RSE and on the
Steering Committee.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

In addition to being a founding member of the Steering Committee, I've
organized and participated in multiple events aimed at increasing awareness of
RSE roles and the US-RSE Association.  In the past year, I helped organize and
participated in a panel on RSE careers for PEARC21, which helps keep US-RSE
connected to the broader research computing community.  I also helped organize
and participated in an [early career
panel](https://academicdatascience.org/cdn/early-career-panel) with the
[Academic Data Science Alliance](https://academicdatascience.org) on RSE and
data science careers in academia.  I shared experiences trying to build RSE
services at Northwestern via a workshop at SIAM-CSE21.

I co-chair a Campus Research Computing Consortium ([CaRCC](https://carcc.org))
[working group on
professionalization](https://carcc.org/rcd-professionalization/) of research
computing and data positions (including RSEs).  This connection across
organizations helps to coordinate activities and incorporate RSE concerns as
part of broader conversations about research computing and data work.

Within US-RSE, I am part of the website committee.  Behind the scenes, I work
to keep our membership list up to date and handle logistics related to our
community tools (Slack, email lists, etc.).  I am also a reviewer for the
Journal of Open Source Software ([JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/)).

## Chen Zhang

**Why do you want to be on the US-RSE Steering Committee?**

As a research software engineer working on developing scientific software for
the instrument scientists at SNS and HFIR, Oak Ridge National Lab, I believe my
experience can help improve the field of research software engineering by
prompting the concept and capability of RSE to the synchrotron  and neutron
facility.

**How do you contribute to the US-RSE Association or RSE community more broadly?**

Using my first-hand experience as well as my interaction with other RSE at the
facility, I can help prompting the importance of adopting the standard research
software engineering practice in modern research field.  Furthermore, my
interaction with the scientists can help identify the weak links in the current
RSE practice, paving road for a better RSE community where both the research
software engineers and the users (scientists) can benefits from quality
software.
