We are excited to announce that through a generous grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, we will be able to hold the first US-RSE Association community building workshop, April 21-22, 2020 in Princeton, NJ.
This won't be an attempt to be an RSE conference, but a workshop focused on planning the best path forward to grow the US-RSE Association.


The workshop will have breakout sessions focused on a number of different topics pertinent to the US-RSE community.
We’ll be working together to generate content for the us-rse.org website that promotes and supports current/future RSEs in alignment with the [mission](https://us-rse.org/mission/) of the US-RSE Association. We will also plan follow-up activities to grow the community.  
More specific workshop information and details will follow in the coming weeks.

You can find out more and express interest in attending by filling out the **[US-RSE Workshop Interest Form](https://forms.gle/tzronZUGdUTT9zzb9)**.
Even though we have to keep this workshop small, remember that there are many ways to get more involved in the community and help grow the US-RSE Association.
There are the #website and #socialmedia channels on the [US-RSE Slack](https://usrse.slack.com/) to talk about improvements to the website and to our social media presence.  You can write a blog post or participate in [RSE Stories](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/). You can also contribute your personal blog feed about your RSE experiences at the [US-RSE syndicated blog](https://us-rse.org/blog).
We're also looking for folks to help define membership and voting rules, reach out to invite new members into our community, and plan future events to bring RSEs together. 
See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjVD0WkeeWZJI6yqSKyMdIjtClzolsxv75RkpLju17I/edit) for some ways to get involved.
If you have another idea but aren't sure how to get started, the [Steering Committee](https://us-rse.org/steering-committee/) would be happy to help.  Reach out on Slack or email us all at contact@us-rse.org.

The [US-RSE Workshop Interest Form](https://forms.gle/tzronZUGdUTT9zzb9) will be open until at least December 3, 2019.
We will strive to accommodate as many as possible, but workshop space is limited and we are committed to ensuring a broadly diverse participant group, both in terms of traditional diversity measures, but also in terms of research domain and institutional representation.
We feel strongly that a diverse community represents more potential members, has more sources for ideas, and has fewer shared assumptions that might hinder the growth of the US-RSE Association.
