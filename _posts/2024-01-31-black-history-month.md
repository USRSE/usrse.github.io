US-RSE's [DEI working group (DEI-WG)](https://us-rse.org/wg/dei/) is proud to
lead the US-RSE's participation in celebrating [Black History
Month](https://www.blackhistorymonth.gov/).

Throughout the month, US-RSE members will be sharing stories that recognize and
celebrate inspirational African Americans who have been involved in computing,
science, engineering, and/or math, and have inspired our members through their
accomplishments in their careers and their personal stories. We'll be
publishing these posts throughout February to highlight such people, where we
talk about the person and tie their work and life to the RSE movement.

Conversations around race in tech are happening daily, and there are numerous
articles on the topic. One of the articles we want to share is a 2021 article
from ACM that interviewed an array of Black ACM Fellows, volunteers and members
about their careers in computing. [Black History Month
