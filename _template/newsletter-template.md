Are you making plans to join us in 🦅 **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 🦅 October 6-8, 2025**? The theme for the third annual conference from the United States Research Software Engineer Association ([US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/)) is **“Code, Practices, and People.”** 

The conference organizers are pleased to share that we received many high quality submissions to the upcoming conference. Thank you to all who submitted your work! Reviews are underway and notifications should be sent by July 14. Registration will open in June.

**While the submission deadline for most formats has passed, we continue to invite poster submissions for [USRSE'25](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/)**.  Poster submissions will be accepted through July 20, 2025\. 

Whether you’re a research software engineer, data scientist, digital humanist, scientific programmer, software developer, or research software user, US-RSE is where people at the intersection of code and research come together. The USRSE'25 conference is your chance to connect with peers, mentors, and experts in the fast-growing world of research software. Don’t just take our word for it—100% of last year's post-conference survey respondents said they would return and recommend the conference to others.

Visit the [conference website](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/participate/) for further details including:

- Venue, hotel, and travel [details](https://us-rse.org/usrse25/attend/) 
- Posters: how and where to submit (still have questions? contact [usrse2025@easychair.org](mailto:usrse2025@easychair.org))

# 🤝 **4. Organizational Founding Membership**

US-RSE envisions a future where Research Software Engineers are universally respected for advancing science, technology, and society through the transformative power of research software engineering.
We’re excited to share that the momentum around our Organizational Founding Membership continues to grow! Our current members are listed below, and organizations that join on or before November 30, 2025, will be recognized in perpetuity as founding members. Founding organizations will also lock in current membership fees through December 31, 2028.
Organizational support helps sustain and expand vital community offerings, including the annual conference, monthly calls and newsletter, job board, working groups, and new resources.

Please reach out to Sandra Gesing at [sandra@us-rse.org](mailto:sandra@us-rse.org) if you are interested in becoming an organizational founding member!

### **Community Calls**

<!--Community call news goes here-->

The next community call topic will be on **AI in Research Software Engineering** and will take place on June 13th at 1PM CDT/2PM EST. Please visit the [Community Calls Website](https://us-rse.org/events/category/#community-call) for more information and to access the registration link.

> It’s been almost two years since we lasted talked about AI, ChatGPT, and LLMs in RSEng, and a lot has changed in that time! Let’s get together and share how we’re using these tools today to write code, check code, or otherwise help out in our roles as RSEs. What do they mean for our job? How are they best deployed? Do they create trustworthy code? Or maybe you use them for research rather than for creating code for research? What do they mean for the next generation of research software engineers? These and so many more questions will be discussed at our next community call.

***May Community Call (Past)***   

The May Community Call was about the upcoming **USRSE'25 Conference**, and is available on YouTube:

🦄 They Arrived as a Herd… But They’re Ready to Travel to You! 🚀

[The 2025 US-RSE magical unicorns have officially arrived!](https://give.communityin.org/unicorn2025?ref=ab_20w0PysS59P20w0PysS59P)


<div style="overflow: hidden;">

       style="float: left; max-width: 300px; width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; border-radius: 10px;">

  <p>
    They came as a herd, packed together in a carton, just like how research software engineers come together to build a stronger community. But now, these unicorns are ready to set off on their own journeys—finding new homes with RSEs, allies, and supporters like you.
  </p>

  <p>
    This year’s edition proudly wears a red shirt featuring the US-RSE logo integrated with 2025, symbolizing another year of growth, collaboration, and impact. Just like our community, these unicorns remind us that while we each have our own paths, we are part of something bigger—a movement dedicated to advancing research software and supporting those who make it happen.
  </p>

  <p>
    By adopting a unicorn, you’re not just getting a fun desk companion—you’re also supporting US-RSE’s mission to strengthen the RSE community, advocate for recognition, and create more opportunities for collaboration.
  </p>

  <p>
    📦 Limited supply—once they leave the herd, they’re gone!
  </p>

  <p>
    🚚 They’ll ship for free within the US! 🚚
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're from another country and want to get your hands on a unicorn, reach out to us, and we'll find out whether we can arrange shipping for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a piece of US-RSE magic and donate to get your Unicorn 2025 Edition today. This edition will be available while supplies last until December 10, 2025 ✨🦄✨
