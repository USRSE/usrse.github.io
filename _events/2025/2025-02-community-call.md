Our **February Community Call** will be all about **Open Source Software Foundations** on Friday, February 14, at 2pm ET/1pm CT/12pm MT/11am PT.

There are a number of Open Source Software Foundations, such as [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), [HPSF](https://hpsf.io/), [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/), [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/org/), [OMSF](https://omsf.io/), etc. These foundations provide a neutral home for software projects, and also a non-profit that can accept donations, and in many cases, can apply for grants and hire staff.  In this call, we'll first hear from two foundations, Leah Silen for NumFOCUS and Christian Trott for HPSF, then we'll hear from a few projects that are part of such foundations (including Matt Thompson from Open Force Field and Andrew Fullard from TARDIS), and finally we'll have an open Q&A about such foundations with attendees.
