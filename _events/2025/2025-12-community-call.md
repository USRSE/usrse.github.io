Our **December Community Call** will be about **RSE Careers: Hiring, Getting Hired, and Everything in Between** on Friday, December 12, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT.

In spite of the title Research Software Engineer, a number of us are involved with hardware as well. Have you built, modified, worked with, or integrated hardware into a system for research? Have you built or maintained hardware-adjacent software? Come tell us about it! Are you just curious about how software engineers could ever end up working with circuits and mechanical bits? Join us to see some examples of projects by members of our community and discuss the unique challenges of integrating the physical with the digital.

The typical structure of a community call starts with an overview of recent US-RSE updates, followed by short presentations. After the presentations we will break out into smaller groups in which we discuss the call topic. Everyone is welcome to join the discussion or just hang back and listen in. If you prefer just to listen in, that is perfectly fine, but we encourage you to share your opinions and thoughts as you feel comfortable. If you want to switch to another group, this is also fine. Just go back to the main room and let the call organizers know.
