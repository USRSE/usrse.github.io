We'll meet in the restaurant section of [Namu Durham](https://www.yelp.com/biz/namu-durham), 5420 Durham-Chapel Hill Blvd, Durham, NC 27707.
I'm planning to stay there until 7pm at least, so no worries if you're running late.
Please <a href="mailto:gaurav@ggvaidya.com">email me</a> or message me on Slack if you can't find us.
