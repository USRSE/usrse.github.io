Our **July Community Call** will be about **Getting to Know the US-RSE Community** on Thursday, July 10, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT.

In this monthâ€™s community call we want to give everyone a chance to get to know their fellow community members. Where did everyone come from? What type of work are they doing? Where are they going? Do they know? And more broadly, where do we as a community think the RSE profession as a whole is heading? What does it even mean to be an RSE? Will there be more positions funded by sources other than grants? Or will we see a decline in dedicated RSE positions? Come and join us and share your thoughts, hear from others, and get to know other US-RSE members better.

The typical structure of a community call starts with an overview of recent US-RSE updates, followed by short presentations. After the presentations we will break out into smaller groups in which we discuss the call topic. Everyone is welcome to join the discussion or just hang back and listen in. If you prefer just to listen in, that is perfectly fine, but we encourage you to share your opinions and thoughts as you feel comfortable. If you want to switch to another group, this is also fine. Just go back to the main room and let the call organizers know.
