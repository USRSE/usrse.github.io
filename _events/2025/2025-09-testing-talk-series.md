The Testing working group is happy to announce a new talk on Software Testing on Wednesday September 17, 1-2 PM EDT. 
Title: **"Automated Testing vs The Enemies of the Release Process"** Presenter: **Ben Clifford**

### Abstract

Ben has been working on code-level sustainability for the Parsl Project
for the last couple of years. In this talk, he'll go over the transition
of the project from manual annual releases to automated weekly releases,
with a focus on the automated testing leading to that in the context of
social, technical and administrative issues specifically affecting
research code projects.


### Biography

Ben has worked in a number of fields, usually with a focus on distributed
systems, functional programming and advanced debugging. He's worked in
research, startups and larger industrial projects. Long ago he thought he
would be a train driver, a physicist and a mathematician. He is a
freelancer and you can hire him to fix your problems.
