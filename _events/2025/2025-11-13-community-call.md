Our **November Community Call** will be about **Funding for Research Software Engineering!** on Thursday, November 13, 2025, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT.

It’s no secret—funding for RSEs and RSE work can sometimes feel like hunting for treasure without a map. In this month’s community call, we’re diving into the big questions: How do you find funding? How do you actually secure it? And perhaps the trickiest part—how do you convince funders that your project (or your role as an RSE) is worth investing in?

But maybe grants aren’t the only answer. Are there other ways to keep a project alive and thriving? Have you found creative approaches to support your work when grants didn’t come through?

We’d love for you to bring your stories—both the epic wins and the “learning experiences” (aka not-so-successful applications). Come swap tips, share laughs, and pick up ideas from others who are navigating the same unpredictable funding waters.

The typical structure of a community call starts with an overview of recent US-RSE updates, followed by short presentations. After the presentations we will break out into smaller groups in which we discuss the call topic. Everyone is welcome to join the discussion or just hang back and listen in. If you prefer just to listen in, that is perfectly fine, but we encourage you to share your opinions and thoughts as you feel comfortable. If you want to switch to another group, this is also fine. Just go back to the main room and let the call organizers know.
