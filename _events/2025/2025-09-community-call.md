Our **September Community Call** will be about **RSE Careers: Hiring, Getting Hired, and Everything in Between** on Thursday, September 11, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT.

Whether you’re frantically job hunting, pondering a career switch, or the one with the ultimate power—hiring RSEs and building teams—this month’s community call is your chance to learn about RSE careers! Are you looking for interviewing tips, either as a candidate or interviewer? Considering how to spot a great RSE among huge piles of applications? Wondering how to get out of an industry role and into academia? Curious about how to translate your research experience into a job as an RSE? Join our community call to discuss all this and more!

The typical structure of a community call starts with an overview of recent US-RSE updates, followed by short presentations. After the presentations we will break out into smaller groups in which we discuss the call topic. Everyone is welcome to join the discussion or just hang back and listen in. If you prefer just to listen in, that is perfectly fine, but we encourage you to share your opinions and thoughts as you feel comfortable. If you want to switch to another group, this is also fine. Just go back to the main room and let the call organizers know.
