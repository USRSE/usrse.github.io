The Testing working group is happy to announce a new talk on Software Testing on Wednesday December 17, 1-2 PM EDT.

Title: **"Testing the (almost) untestable: some ideas for automated testing of scientific software that is big, slow or non-reproducible"** 

Presenter: **Gaurav Vaidya**

### Abstract

Testing libraries and tools have made it easier to ensure that scientific
software work correctly, but some scientific software is too big, slow or
non-reproducible for simple testing. In this presentation, I will describe the
testing and validation strategies and tools that I have developed to test and
validate one such piece of software I currently maintain: the Babel pipelines
that combine identifier cross-references from dozens of biomedical data sources
to generate over 490M sets of equivalent identifiers for the NCATS Translator
project. Please bring your own examples of testing difficult-to-test software
and the strategies you’ve used to test them to share and discuss!


### Biography

Gaurav Vaidya, PhD has been a scientific software developer since his
undergraduate days at the National University of Singapore in the mid-2000s (and
was introduced to automated software testing soon afterwards). He completed his
PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado Boulder in
2017, and has worked as a Semantic Web Technologist at the Renaissance Computing
Institute (RENCI) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill since 2019.
He creates scientific software tools for the NCATS Translator project and the
HEAL Data Stewardship Group, and tries his best to incorporate software testing
into his work wherever he can.
