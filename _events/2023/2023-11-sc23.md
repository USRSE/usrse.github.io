We are excited to announce the Research Software Engineers in HPC Workshop (RSE-HPC-2023)
to be held as part of [SC23](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/) (hybrid event, in Denver, CO and virtually).
This will be a half-day workshop 9:00am-12:30pm MST (UTC-7), Sunday, November 12, 2023.
The theme for this year’s workshop is "Growing the RSE Community."

This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world,
to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current
RSEs and RSE leaders.  We’ll discuss the current activities and plans of national RSE
organizations, discuss the needs of RSEs and RSE groups, and brainstorm ways RSE organizations
can help address these.

Participation is open to all SC23 attendees who have registered to attend the conference workshops.

For more information, see the [workshop website](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2023/)
