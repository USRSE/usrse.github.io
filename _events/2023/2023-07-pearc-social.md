The Outreach working group has two questions for you:

- Are you in the Portland, Oregon area?
- Are you going to [PEARC23](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc23/), taking place this year in Portland, OR?

If you answered _Yes_ to either question, we invite you to join your fellow
RSEs at [Cartside Food Carts](https://www.cartsidepdx.com/), 1825 N Williams. 

We will be meeting at 6 PM Pacific time following the
[Software Engineering for Research Software workshop](https://se4science.org/workshops/se4rs23/index.htm).

This is an informal meet up organized by US-RSE members. 
It's not funded or financially sponsored by US-RSE, so everyone is responsible for their own food & drink.

Any and all are welcome.
