The next community call will be about **Tips for Mentoring around Coding** on **Thursday, May 11, 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT**.

Learning new programming languages, frameworks, technologies, concepts, and other skills is a crucial part of an RSE job. But what are good ways to mentor colleagues and students to learn real-world practical skills so that they can be successfully applied to real-world projects? Often not only the specifics of a project need to be taught, but also a basic understanding of the technology stack a project uses. And in addition to that, sometimes domain knowledge needs to be acquired as well. Are there specific workflows you have found to be helpful? How do you provide mentorship to your colleagues and students? Or maybe you are being onboarded or are onboarding someone new right now and are looking for some ideas how to make the process less painful for everyone? Whatever your motivation, come and join us for an hour of interesting discussion!
