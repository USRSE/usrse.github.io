The inaugural RSE Group Leaders call is an attempt to bring together those who are leading RSE groups to discuss challenges, brainstorm solutions, share information, and develop resources to help us all succeed. The RSE-GLN will focus on topics such as project management, securing funding, hiring and retention, and building institutional support.  

To learn more, please visit the [RSE Group Leaders' Network](https://us-rse.org/wg/rse-gln) page.

A calendar invite with Zoom link will be sent out via email to those who are [registered members of the network](https://us-rse.org/wg/rse-gln).
