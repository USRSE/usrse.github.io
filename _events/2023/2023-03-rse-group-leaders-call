The inaugural RSE Group Leaders call is an attempt to bring together those who are leading RSE groups to discuss challenges, brainstorm solutions, share information, and develop resources to help us all succeed. The network will focus on topics such as project management, securing funding, hiring and retention, and building institutional support.
