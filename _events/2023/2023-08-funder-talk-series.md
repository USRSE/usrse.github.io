### Topic: Scientific Software at NASA

Software has been a common thread across all of NASA's major achievements from the Moon landing to the deepest images of our Universe.  Software plays a key role to NASAâ€™s scientific missions and to the amazing discoveries that come from them.  The development of software is accomplished through the contributions from the engineers, scientists, and community contributing to the range of different scientific software packages.  NASA is taking the next steps to further broaden the impact of open source by applying it to the scientific process with its Open Source Science Initiative. NASA is directly supporting open source scientific software through grants and contributions. To further advance scientific reproducibility and reuse, the scientific software underlying future scientific results will be made openly available and unrestricted mission software will be developed openly to allow for community contributions.
