[Submission of computational notebooks](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/submissions/notebooks/) are due Monday, May 1, 2023. To account for the broad variety of use cases for notebooks, we are accepting 
submissions in three categories, which were described in detail in the [March 2023 Community Call](https://youtu.be/Z4QXKDIDu6k)
 and are available on the [Notebooks Submissions](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/submissions/notebooks/) page. Submitters 
should use our [Jupyter](https://github.com/USRSE/jupyter-notebook-templates) and [R Notebook
 templates](https://github.com/USRSE/R-notebook-templates) to submit. In order to improve the
 clarity of our expectations, we are hosting a tutorial session. We will…

- briefly review the different submission types
- explain how to select and copy the appropriate template for your language and usecase
- walk through the technical details of using our templates to submit a notebook
- give a quick overview of the peer review process

This live Zoom call will be recorded for reference. [Register here](https://asu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIod-Ghpz4qGNb5O23aWxuKBadudH65Fquy).
