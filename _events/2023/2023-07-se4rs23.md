We are excited to announce the Software Engineering for Research Software (SE4RS'23) to be held as part of PEARC23 in Portland, OR. This will be a half-day workshop 1:30pm-4:30pm PDT (UTC-7), Monday, July 24, 2023.

This workshop addresses the need for cross-domain interaction by providing a platform for members of the software engineering community and members of the research software community to interact with each other by sharing perspectives and presenting findings relevant to research, practice, and education. A significant portion of the workshop is devoted to focused interaction among the participants with the goal of generating a research agenda to improve the process, practice, tools, techniques, and experimental methods used in the development of software engineering for research software.
