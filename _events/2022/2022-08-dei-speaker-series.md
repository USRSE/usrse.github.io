### Abstract

Dr. Vandana Singhâ€™s research investigates the experiences of marginalized
groups within technical fields like software engineering and information
technology. In this discussion, Dr. Singh will start by discussing the current
status of Diversity in Open Source Software (OSS), especially with respect to
women of OSS and their experiences of being in OSS communities. Dr. Singh will
share some results from her research on this topic and will discuss recent
events pertinent to Diversity in OSS. Then, we will look at some current
initiatives that address this challenge and together identify what more can be
done. What are the glaring gaps, what should the organizations be doing to
support women in OSS? We will conclude with setting intentions for a stronger
path forward for empowering women and women leaders in OSS with concrete
recommendations for communities and guidelines for women to be successful in
OSS.
