The topic of the November Community Call will be **RSE Project Management: Challenges of Adopting Agile Methodologies in RSE Projects**. It will be held on **November 10, 2022 at 12ET/11CT/10MT/9PT**.

After the amazing Education & Training lecture by Angela Herring on Agile Project Management, this month’s community call will be “all about agile development.” Have you struggled with incorporating agile methodologies into your software development process? Have you invented your own methodology that you would like to share? Would you like to discuss challenges you encountered and solutions you found with like-minded people? This community call is for you then! Come and join us for an hour of agile fun!
