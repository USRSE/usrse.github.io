Research Software Engineers (RSEs) bridge the gap between traditional software
engineering and domain science research. These developers have a unique
combination of skills to combine expertise in software development with a
deep understanding of the scientific field for which software is being written.

This workshop will present RSE contributions to scientific research through
a series of talks that explore scientific project needs, how access to RSEs
made the project successful, and how this work can be applied to future
scientific research efforts. The workshop will be of interest to existing
RSEs, potential RSEs, domain scientists, and software developers who want
to understand the lessons from both good and bad research software
engineering experiences.

The workshop will consist of a keynote speaker and shorter lightning talks
that lead into interactive panel discussions and breakout groups. Results
will be published as both a post-workshop report and as smaller blog posts
on the US-RSE website and BSSw.io. Prospective participants are encouraged
to submit their papers through the formal eScience 2022 process, through
which proceedings will be published.

To be held as part of [eScience 2022](https://www.escience-conference.org/2022/),
Salt Lake City, Utah, October 11-14, 2022. The exact workshop date is
**TO BE DETERMINED**, but more information can be found on the
[workshop website](https://us-rse.org/rse-escience-2022).
