# RSE Code Testing Practices

The next community call will be on February 10, 2022 at 12ET/11CT/10MT/9PT.

This month we are hosting a call about Testing [issue 20](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues/20) and [issue 22](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues/22)!

Most developers will agree that testing is an important part of software development. But is testing of research software any different than testing of other types of software? Is testing in a research context different from testing in general software enterprises? And how and what do you test in the first place? What can we learn from each other and from practices elsewhere?

The call will discuss, and share knowledge and experiences, around questions such as why you would want to test and what the benefits are, what technologies are out there, and what processes RSEs do (and don’t) employ to test their software. No matter if you have never heard of testing or if you are an expert, come join us for an interesting discussion and to hear and share some “testimonies” of what has worked and not worked for others. 

Mark Ciechanowski will kick things off with a lightning talk "Unit Testing - Why Test, The Motivation, and Where To Start With Python pytest."

The talk will be followed by breakouts to compare and capture things we are (and aren't) doing! 

Look forward to seeing some of you Feb 10......
