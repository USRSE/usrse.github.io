## US-RSE Education & Training Seminar Series

US-RSE is happy to be starting a new series of technical talks and tutorials related to Education & Training for RSEs.

## Event

The inaugural talk of the US-RSE Education & Training Seminar Series will feature Angela Herring from Los Alamos National Laboratory who will speak about Agile Project Management for Research Software.
This event will take place **Wednesday, October 19th at 4 PM ET, 3 PM CT, 2 PM MT, 1 PM PT**

*Abstract*: The Agile project management method, Scrum, has become a standard methodology for developing software for commercial, industrial, and even medical applications. However, Scrum is less commonly used in research environments. In this talk, I will give an overview of basic Scrum methodology and describe modifications I have used to successfully apply Scrum within research software development teams.

*Learning Objectives*:
1. Understand traditional scrum processes as used in industrial applications.
1. Identify the differences between industrial applications and research.
1. Discuss some ways that leaders can modify traditional scrum processes to accommodate research.

*Intended Audience*: Because the talk starts with an overview of Scrum, folks who are new to Scrum will be able to follow the talk. It will be best for an intermediate audience who has some experience with Scrum.
