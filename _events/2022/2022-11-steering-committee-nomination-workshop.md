Are you interested in running for steering committee? Come to this informal workshop where we will...

- explain the nomination process and the responsibilities that come with the role

- help you generate ideas for the nomination prompts and combat imposter syndrome, especially in the case that you have a unique background

- give you enough time and space to complete the entire nomination and ask any questions that come up throughout

This workshop will take place on [Zoom](https://asu.zoom.us/j/85894518643?pwd=S0R4MVY1SktUeWJIazYvRkRDUUtlUT09). Current committee members will start with a brief presentation on the nomination process and the responsibilities of committee members. We will then work through [a worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UB5BVBh9uaZ1thVPeweP2kbEDAZdKWM9l_qBghEbREk/edit?usp=sharing) to help participants generate ideas and material for the nomination statement. Finally, we will give you time to draft your full statement while remaining availble to answer any remaining question you have or provide feedback. We especially encourage you to come to the workshop if you have questions about what constitutes a relevant experience or if you are struggling with imposter syndrome. If you can't make it to the workshop, [the worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UB5BVBh9uaZ1thVPeweP2kbEDAZdKWM9l_qBghEbREk/edit?usp=sharing) should still be useful.
