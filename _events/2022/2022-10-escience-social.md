The Outreach working group has two questions for you:

- Are you in the Salt Lake City area?
- Are you going to the [18th International Conference for eScience](https://www.escience-conference.org/2022/), taking place this year in Salt Lake City, UT?

If you answered _Yes_ to either question, we invite you to join your fellow
RSEs at [HallPass SLC](https://hallpassslc.com/bars-and-eateries/), 153 S Rio Grande St. 

We will be meeting at 6 PM Mountain Time following the
[RSEs in eScience workshop](https://us-rse.org/rse-escience-2022/).

Any and all are welcome.
