# Whitepaper: State of RSE in the US

The next community call will be on June 10, 2022 at 14ET/13CT/12MT/10PT.

The US-RSE monthly community calls are experimenting with a new time to try and better accommodate Alaska and Hawaii time zones. The calls are moving to the **second Friday of each month**. 14:00-15:00 Eastern starting June 2022. Community call topics, and agenda and zoom registration announcements are posted to Slack and sent to US-RSE email lists.

The June 2022 (on **Friday June 10th, 14:00-15:00 US Eastern time**) call will focus on starting a whitepaper on the State of RSE in the US. The call will kickoff with a quick review of some of the recent community calls that touched on this topic. In breakout groups we will try and experiment with outlining a set of key sub-topics and the structure for a whitepaper. Look forward to seeing those of you who can make on the Friday!

Community calls typically have a topical focus. They provide a forum for US-RSE members to compare experiences around a topic, hang-out and chat on zoom.

## Registration details
Information on how to register for the Zoom meeting will be sent via email and posted in the #general channel on Slack.
