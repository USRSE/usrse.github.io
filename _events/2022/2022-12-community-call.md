The topic of the December Community Call will be **Testing large “standard” software stacks in HPC and shared system contexts**. It will be held on **December 9, 2022 at 2 pm ET / 1 pm CT / 12 pm MT / 11 am PT**.

This week’s call will focus on how software stacks for clusters and large HPC systems are maintained and tested. These software stacks are becoming increasingly diverse and many RSE teams contribute to them. Often the software is continually evolving. Are you regularly testing such systems? Or will you have to in the near future? Does it drive you crazy or maybe you love it? Are there lessons we can all share to think about best practices and innovative ideas for ensuring stable but rapidly evolving research stacks? Can we transfer certain best research software engineering practices and experiences to other shared systems? Come join us for an hour of discussion around testing in HPC systems and beyond…!

Also - don’t forget to [vote THIS WEEK for US-RSE steering committee]( https://us-rse.org/about/election/).
