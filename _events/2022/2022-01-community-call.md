# RSE Opportunities

The next community call will be on January 13, 2022 at 12ET/11CT/10MT/9PT.

This month we are hosting a call about [RSE Opportunities](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues/8).

What opportunities are out there for RSEs, and how can US-RSE help connect its members with those opportunities (e.g. publication venues, conferences, workshops, grant opportunities, etc.)? What can US-RSE do for its members or do better? What resources could it provide? This month we would like to talk about these and related questions. If there is something you think US-RSE could help you and others with, if you have an idea for resources US-RSE could provide, or if you simply want to get more involved, come join us on Zoom!

## Registration details
Information on how to register for the Zoom meeting will be sent via email and posted in the #general channel on Slack.
