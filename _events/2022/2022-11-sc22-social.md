The Outreach working group has two questions for you:

- Are you in the Dallas, TX area?
- Are you going to [SC22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/), taking place this year in Dallas, TX?

If you answered _Yes_ to either question, we invite you to join your fellow
RSEs at a to-be-determined location for food, drinks, and fun.

We will be meeting at 6 PM Central Time following the
[RSEs in HPC workshop](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2022/). Check back here or on Slack for details on the location!

Any and all are welcome.
