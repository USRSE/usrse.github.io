## DiveRSE Speaker Series Info

[DiveRSE (Diverse RSE)](https://diverse-rse.github.io/) is a series of talks
and related activities including discussion and panel sessions designed to
support and raise awareness of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)
challenges and successes within the research software community.

## Event - Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in the R Community

DiveRSE is delighted to welcome Dr Heather Turner from the University of Warwick,
UK as the next speaker in the DiveRSE talk series.

Register for this talk via [Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUsduuorjItHtRqDKkgy-wqQv1hgnI2NbUZ).

### Abstract

Since the beginnings of the R project around 30 years ago, a large community of
users and developers has formed around it. As the community grew, a lack of
diversity became increasingly apparent and in recent years there have been
various efforts to make the community more diverse and inclusive. Some of
these efforts have been “top-down” - led by organizations such as the R
Foundation or R Consortium - and others have been “bottom-up” - initiated by
individuals, often leading to the formation of community groups or projects.
In this talk I will give an overview of these initiatives and their impact.
I will also discuss recent and ongoing work to improve EDI in the community of
contributors to the R project itself. This work is being led by the R
Contribution Working Group and is the focus of my Research Software Engineering
Fellowship funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK).

Following the talk, there will be time for questions and general discussion.

This talk is being supported by the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/).
