We are excited to announce the Research Software Engineers in HPC Workshop (RSE-HPC-2022)
to be held as part of [SC22](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/) (hybrid event, in Dallas, TX and virtually).
This will be a half-day workshop 2:00pm-5:30pm CST (UTC-6), Sunday, November 13, 2022.

This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world,
to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current
RSEs and RSE leaders.  We’ll discuss the current activities and plans of national RSE
organizations, discuss the needs of RSEs and RSE groups, and brainstorm ways RSE organizations
can help address these.

We encourage prospective participants to submit position papers (limit of 2 pages,
not counting references; no format prescribed) on topics related to RSE issues.
Papers and discussion topics should be submitted using the submission website.
The deadline for submissions is Friday, August 5, 2022, at 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12).
