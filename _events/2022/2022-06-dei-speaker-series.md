## US-RSE DEI-WG Speaker Series Info

The US-RSE DEI-WG is working to bring to the US-RSE community quarterly visits
from RSE professionals with vested interests or research into DEI in the RSE
community at large. Our community pledges to continually educate ourselves
through research on best practices focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
The US-RSE is committed to providing an inclusive environment with equitable
treatment for all and to promoting and encouraging diversity throughout the RSE
community. We encourage everyone to suggest speakers and topics and are open to
different formats and timelines of the events. Feedback is much appreciated.


## Event

The US-RSE Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group (DEI-WG) is proud to
welcome Alexander Serebrenik to present his talk "Diversity in Open-source Software."
This event will take place **Wednesday, June 1st at 8AM Pacific/ 11AM Eastern / 5PM GSET**

[**Register on Zoom**]()

### Abstract

Software development is, by nature, a social activity: the ability of individuals
and teams to work together effectively is critical to the success of software
projects. For that reason, the goal of my research is to study the individual
and collaborative aspects of software development and how they influence the
creation and evolution of high-quality software systems. Today, software
development teams are increasingly distributed, dynamic, and diverse, and I have
focused on understanding the impact that these trends have on software
development practice. For example, in open-source software contexts, we observe
that more gender diverse teams are more productive, and that they are less
likely to exhibit suboptimal team communication patterns leading to suboptimal
source code organization; likewise, emerging evidence paints a nuanced picture
in which diversity in culture, age, and other characteristics influence teaming
behaviors in complex ways. I will explore recent investigations into these topics
and what they tell us about how to build strong and healthy software teams,
communities, and ecosystems.

### Biography

Alexander Serebrenik is a Full Professor of Social Software Engineering at the
Software Engineering and Technology cluster of Eindhoven University of
Technology (TU/e). His research goal is to facilitate the evolution of software
by taking into account social aspects of software development. His work tends
to involve theories and methods both from within computer science (e.g.,
theory of socio-technical coordination; methods from natural language processing,
machine learning) and from outside of computer science (e.g.,
organizational psychology). The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism,
i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in
observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and
the technical perspectives. Prof. Serebrenik has co-authored a book,
Evolving Software Systems (Springer Verlag, 2014), and more than 100 scientific
papers and articles.
