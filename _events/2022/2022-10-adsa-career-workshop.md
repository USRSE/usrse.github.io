The [Academic Data Science Alliance (ADSA)](https://academicdatascience.org) and the US Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE) are hosting an in-person 2-day [workshop](https://academicdatascience.org/adsa-meetings/2022-fall-workshop) on October 24-25, 2022 focused on elucidating best practices for recruitment, career development, and retention of staff data scientists and research software engineers in academic settings. **The primary outcome of this workshop will be a guide book** that addresses how data scientists, research software engineers, hiring managers, and administrators can successfully create rewarding career paths for these new types of positions.

The workshop will have breakout sessions focused on a number of different topics pertinent to academic careers for RSEs and data scientists. The format will be semi-unconference style, with some pre-selected topic areas and some group-generated topics. Participants will be expected to actively engage in content creation throughout the workshop and participate in writing, review, and editing of the end product(s) after the workshop has concluded.

The event will be held in the [Rubenstein Forum](https://davidrubensteinforum.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. We are arranging a room block at the nearby [Study Hotel](https://www.thestudyatuniversityofchicago.com). Some travel and hotel funding will be available for those that do not have alternative sources of funding to cover their attendance.

If you are interested in participating in this workshop, please use this form to tell us a little about yourself and your interest and expertise in this area. **Applications should be submitted by June 15, 2022.** 

The workshop program committee will invite approximately 40 participants. Those not selected for participation may be contacted at a later date to assist with reviewing material produced at the workshop. We will notify applicants of their participation status by July 8, 2022.
