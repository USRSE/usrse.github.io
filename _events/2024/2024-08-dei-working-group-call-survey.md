The next DEI Working Group (@wg-dei) meeting is scheduled for **Thursday,
August 8th at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET**.

The US-RSE is planning a member survey and values your input on its content. To
ensure the survey aligns with our DEI goals, we'd like to discuss specific
items at the upcoming meeting. If you're unable to attend, please share your
thoughts on the [Google Doc
Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CrIzhPSvzzjRW4vmJxbKPoWegiBay7HH1fkzmNMlm-c/edit?usp=sharing).
We'll distribute a meeting summary for additional feedback.

We look forward to your participation!
