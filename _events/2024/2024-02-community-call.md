Our **February Community Call** will be all about **Keeping Up With Changing Technology** on Friday, February 9, 2pm ET/1pm CT/12pm MT/11am PT.


Technology is rapidly advancing and for many projects this poses questions such as when to upgrade a technology, when to switch frameworks, or when to rebuild a tool. Limited funding complicates the matter further in that projects sometimes have to come to an end. Have you dealt with such situations? How do you decide when to switch or upgrade part or all of your project, or when to let a project end? What lessons have you learned and what experiences can you share? Come join us for an hour of discussion about the pains and joys of being an RSE in an ever changing technological world!
