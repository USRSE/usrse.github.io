Our **June Community Call** will be about **Getting to Know US-RSE: Working Groups** on Friday, June 14, 2pm ET/1pm CT/12pm MT/11am PT.

US-RSE has 10 official working groups! In our June community call, we will introduce you to what working groups are within US-RSE and how to form a new one. We then will have 4 of US-RSEâ€™s working groups introduce themselves, give you a chance to talk to them about what they are working on, and learn how to join them. Join us for an hour filled with group discussion and learn about what your peers are so passionate about that they dedicate extra time to it.

The working groups who will present at our community call are:
- Group Leaders
- Education and Training 
- DEI 
- Code Review 
- RSE Empowerment in National Labs 
- User Experience
