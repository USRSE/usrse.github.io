## US-RSE Education & Training Seminar Series

US-RSE periodically presents technical talks and tutorials related to Education & Training for RSEs.

## Event

The next technical talk of the US-RSE Education & Training Seminar Series will feature Jonathan Woodring "Eating Your Own Dogfood (Testing Your Software Before the Scientists Break It)."
This event will take place **Wednesday, August 28th at 1-3 PM ET, 12-2 PM CT, 11-1 PM MT, 10 AM - 12 PM PT**

*Abstract*: One of the best ways to test your software is to become your #1 user. While this doesn't catch every single bug, because your users are
clever, it will catch many of them before they'll ever see them. I'll show how our integrated testing runs "the real world," by continually exercising our
software with actual scenarios. The benefits include: (1) being annoyed with your own software, so you'll develop new features to assist the users
(actual features, not "features"), (2) automatically writing the dreaded documentation that we all hate spending our time on, and (3) breaking your
software before your users, saving you from answering (fewer) phone calls and emails.

*Learning Objectives*:
1. Understanding testing, documentation, and feature development

*Intended Audience*: Software developers/engineers/scientists.


Attendees are expected to follow the [US-RSE Code of Conduct](https://us-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/).

### Biography

Jon earned his PhD in computer science from The Ohio State University, specializing in computer
graphics and scientific visualization. He has been a staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory since
2009, where he began his career as a research scientist, developing methods for scientific visualization and
high performance computing. Currently, Jon develops and supports software tools for scientific simulation
setup, primarily for creating "code links": using the output of one simulation as the input to another.
