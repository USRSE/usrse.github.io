The next community call will be on August 12, 2021 at 12ET/11CT/10MT/9PT.

This month we are hosting a call on the topic of [To PhD or not to PhD, that is the question!](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues/6)

How often are people looking for jobs in RSEng turned away because they don't have a PhD? Is this along with standard biases (ageism, gender, race, etc.) another, potentially less noticeable one, that we have? Does someone need to have a PhD to be considered for an RSEng role? And if so, why? What if they had tried that track and it's assuredly not for them? This month’s community call provides a chance to discuss under what circumstances a PhD is actually meaningful for an RSEng role, and when not.

In preparation for the community call, if you can, please checkout the discussion that has started on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues/6). And if you have any materials, resources, or experiences you’d like to share, we encourage you to do so by adding a comment!

**Registration details**  
Information on how to register for the Zoom meeting will be sent via email and posted in the #general channel on Slack.
