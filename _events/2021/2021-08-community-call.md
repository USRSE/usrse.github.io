The next community call will be on August 12, 2021 at 12ET/11CT/10MT/9PT.

This month we are hosting a call on the topic of [To PhD or not to PhD, that is the question!](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues/6)

It’s not uncommon to meet people looking for jobs in RSEng that are turned away because they don't have a PhD. Arguably along with standard biases (ageism, gender, race, etc.) this is another one that we have, albeit less susceptible to notice. Why does someone need to have a PhD to be considered for an RSEng role? What if they had tried that track and it's assuredly not for them? This month’s community call provides a chance to discuss under what circumstances a PhD is actually meaningful for an RSEng role, and when not.

In preparation for the community call, if you can, please checkout the discussion that has started on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues/6). And if you have any materials, resources, or experiences you’d like to share, we encourage you to do so by adding a comment!
