take to create more inclusive technical cultures.  Attendees will learn key
features of strategic, research-based approaches to address the biases and
barriers that limit diverse participation in computing.

## US-RSE DEI-WG Speaker Series

The US-RSE Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group (DEI-WG) is working
to bring to the US-RSE community quarterly visits from RSE professionals with
vested interests or research into DEI in the RSE community at large. Our
community pledges to continually educate ourselves through research on best
practices focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The US-RSE is
committed to providing an inclusive environment with equitable treatment for
all and to promoting and encouraging diversity throughout the RSE community. We
encourage everyone to suggest speakers and topics and are open to different
formats and timelines of the events. Feedback is much appreciated.
