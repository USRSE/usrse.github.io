We are excited to announce that through a generous grant from the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, we will be able to hold a first US-RSE
Association community building workshop, October 5-6, 2021 in
Princeton, NJ. This won’t be an attempt to be an RSE conference, but a
workshop focused on planning the best path forward to grow the US-RSE
Association.

The workshop will have breakout sessions focused on a number of
different topics pertinent to the US-RSE community. We’ll be working
together to generate content for the us-rse.org website that promotes
and supports current/future RSEs in alignment with the mission of the
US-RSE Association. We will also plan follow-up activities to grow the
community.

More information, including how to participate, can be found on the
[workshop event page](https://us-rse.org/first-community-workshop/).
