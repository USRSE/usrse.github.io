including self-nominations, for the [US-RSE Steering Committee
election](https://us-rse.org/about/election/) are now open. Nominations are due
November 5, 2021.

Interested members are encouraged to [nominate
themselves](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoLAWkUqsv7axDFnaV3GEw0gRBDemqSztbxKTtGr7EE1rWqA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Alternatively, if you know of a member who you think would make a good
candidate, you can [submit a nomination for someone
else](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoLAWkUqsv7axDFnaV3GEw0gRBDemqSztbxKTtGr7EE1rWqA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Nominations of others will only be shared with the Election Chair and the
nominated individual. The Election Chair will contact the nominated individual
to let them know they were nominated, and by whom, and to confirm their
interest in participating. The information will not be made public.
