The next US-RSE community call is on April 8th at 12ET/11CT/10MT/9PT.

The main topic of discussion is
**"RSEs in National Labs"**

Charles Ferenbaugh from LANL will be a guest organizer and host a call
on the topic of [RSEs at National Labs](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues/7).
This call will look at the RSE landscape and practices in what are
formally known as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers ([FFRDCs](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/)).
These facilities cover all manner of software for technical disciplines including
weather forecasting, COVID research, stockpile stewardship, 
national security, computer science and systems work, energy generation and, of course, software for [landing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg) 
(and soon [flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYjknNxGuJw)) a helicopter on Mars. 
The millions of lines of software involved in these activities come from real live teams of RSEs and 
others acting in RSE roles. This call will be a forum for National Lab 
RSEs to compare and contrast how they do what they do and get to know each other. It will also be a chance for
everyone in USRSE to learn a bit about the different approaches,
methodologies and culture found in FFRDC facilities.
