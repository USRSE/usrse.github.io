The next US-RSE community call is on June 10th at 12ET/11CT/10MT/9PT.

The main topic of discussion is
**"Open Source Development"**

This month we are hosting a call
on the topic of [Open Source Development](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues/4).
By chance this is the day after the first [Global Maintainer Summit](https://globalmaintainersummit.github.com) and
three days after [Upstream 2021](https://explore.tidelift.com/upstream/)! So it seems like a good week
to have some conversations and strategizing around this topic.
This call will be a chance to explore with others in the US-RSE community how we are 
individually or in groups, utilizing, contributing to or maintaining open source software.
Some discussion topics will include, how is everyone using open-source, what tools are up and coming, what are
some of the ways people are interacting with the open source ecosystem around licenses, integration into day-to-day work,
contributions and participation.
