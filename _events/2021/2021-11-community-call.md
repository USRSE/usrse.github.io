US-RSE community on November 10th, 2021 at 12ET/11CT/10MT/9PT.


( NOTE - Wednesday event due to Veterans Day on the Thursday).

The main topic of discussion is

**Current Technologies**


RSE work involves staying on top of and learning about a sometimes mind-boggling number of always emerging technologies. 
In this month's call, we will experiment with some show-and-tell where we can compare notes on what technologies people are using, learning about, or interested in learning about. 
We will also chat about how people are learning about new technologies. 
The call will have a couple of lightning talks on fun new technologies to set everyone thinking. 
Look forward to seeing everyone who can make it.
