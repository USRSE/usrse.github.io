We are excited to announce the [Research Software Engineers in HPC Workshop
(RSE-HPC-2021)](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2021/) to be held as part of [SC21](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/) (in St. Louis, MO and virtually). This will be a full-day workshop 9:00am-5:30pm CST (UTC-6), Monday, November 15, 2021.

This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders. Weâ€™ll discuss the current activities and plans of national RSE organizations, discuss the needs of RSEs and RSE groups, and write a report on ways RSE organizations can help address these.

The full program is posted on the [workshop website](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2021/).  For more information, see the website or contact the organizers at sc-ws-rse-hpc (at-sign) info.supercomputing.org.
