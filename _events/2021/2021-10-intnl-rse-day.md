On October 14th between 11:00 AM and 4:45 PM Eastern time we will be hosting a series of online
talks and panels with discussion to celebrate the [First International RSE Day](https://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html). Events 
begin on the hour between 11:00 AM and 4:00 PM Eastern; feel free to join us for some or all

**Background**

_First International RSE Day Virtual Workshop Events Oct 14, 11:00 AM Eastern - 4:45 PM Eastern._

An NSF-funded workshop titled “Building the research innovation workforce: a workshop
to identify new insights and directions to advance the research computing community” recently found that collaborations between research software engineers, cyberinfrastructure professionals, and researchers were key to the research computing community [https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/files/ciworkforce2020/report.pdf](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/files/ciworkforce2020/report.pdf). 

But what do successful RSE, CI professional, and researcher teams and stakeholder interactions look like? How are they funded and how did people get started in this career?

Join us for a panel discussion and talks to introduce teams of researchers, RSEs, and CI professionals and learn about their experiences in the research computing community.
