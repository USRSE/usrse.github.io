**Background**

_First International RSE Day Virtual Workshop Events Oct 14, 11:00 AM Eastern - 4:30 PM Eastern._

An NSF-funded workshop titled “[Building the research innovation workforce: a workshop
to identify new insights and directions to advance the research computing community” recently found that collaboration between research software engineers, cyberinfrastructure professionals, and researchers were key to the research computing community [https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/files/ciworkforce2020/report.pdf](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/files/ciworkforce2020/report.pdf). 

But what do successful RSE, CI professional, and researcher teams and stakeholder interactions look like? How are they funded and how did people get started in this career?

Join us for a panel discussion and talks to introduce teams of researchers, RSEs, and CI professionals and learn about their experiences in the research computing community.
