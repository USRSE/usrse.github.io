**Better Allies Part III: Increasing Your Impact**

In an effort to promote continual education and discussion, the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group (DEI-WG) at the US-RSE is running a book club / discussion group.

[Dr. Cherri Pancake](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/people/cherri-pancake) gave an inspiring talk, ["Can We Change the Face of Computing?"](https://us-rse.org/events/2021/2021-03-dei-speaker-series) to kick off our DEI Speaker Series and was enthusiastic about the book "Better Allies: Everyday Actions to Create Inclusive, Engaging Workplaces" by Karen Catlin, so this is the first book we're choosing to read and discuss.

The discussion will be in three parts, following the structure of the book. **Previous attendance to parts one and two of this event is not required.**
