The Testing working group is happy to announce a new talk on Software
Testing on Wednesday February 18, 1-2 PM EST.

Title: **Your Requirements Specification as an Executable Test Suite** 

Presenter: **Brad Richardson**

### Abstract

Automated testing is a well established best practice in software
development, so you are writing test suites for your projects right?
But how useful is your test suite after you have finished writing it?
Does it help you to pinpoint the source of bugs? Does it help you to
make changes to functionality, or get in the way? Would a new
developer find it useful for getting their bearings in your project?
Can you tell which requirement a given test is meant to verify?

Experience in the nuclear power industry, with its emphasis on quality
assurance and high standards for verification, provides motivation to
always have satisfactory answers to these questions. This presentation
provides guidance for writing a well organized suite of tests that
leads to positive answers to the previous questions. The primary
lesson is that a test suite organized as an executable verification of
the requirements of the project provides long term value in the form
of easier on-boarding for new team members and increased developer
productivity during maintenance activities. Examples and
demonstrations are provided using the Veggies Fortran Unit Testing
Framework, which has been designed to aid in writing test suites of
the form described above.

### Biography

Brad Richardson has a variety of experience and qualifications related
to scientific and engineering software development and maintenance. He
has been involved in the development and/or maintenance of multiple,
highly-complex, safety-related, legacy software packages used in
various scientific and engineering fields. Brad has also been involved
in the development of multiple newer open-source software packages,
making use of modern software development tools and techniques. Brad
has taught multiple classes, including on the basics of version
control with git, modern Fortran basics, software design patterns in
Fortran, and modern software development practices (i.e. unit testing
and continuous integration). Brad currently works as a Research
Software Engineer in the NASA Flight Sciences Laboratory Computing
Center at Johnson Space Center, where he assists systems
administrators with automating tasks, as well as scientists and
engineers in developing and optimizing their software to run on center
clusters.
