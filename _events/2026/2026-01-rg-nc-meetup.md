<!-- Putting the Zoom link in the text looks ugly on the website, but it adds the Zoom link to the summary included in the downloaded event. -->
We'll meet on Zoom ([https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86736347243?pwd=VxcVga9fO3AtbTNbqxajz7IHWeoxXa.1](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86736347243?pwd=VxcVga9fO3AtbTNbqxajz7IHWeoxXa.1)).
I'm planning to stay on the Zoom until 7pm, so no worries if you're running late.
Please <a href="mailto:gaurav@ggvaidya.com">email me</a> or message me on Slack if you can't get in.

You can find out more about our group on [our regional group page]({{ site.baseurl }}/ag/rg-north-carolina/)
or by joining the [US-RSE Slack `#rg-north-carolina` channel](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/rg-north-carolina)
(you will need to [join US-RSE]({{site.baseurl}}/join/) first!).

## Meeting notes
* Detailed notes are available [on Slack](https://usrse.slack.com/docs/T8ZT4PJSW/F0AA6F82JHY)
* What should we do as a group?
  * Start with casual, social meetings, then work our way up to larger meetings with invited speakers.
  * We could have themed causal meetings -- "Next month we'll meet at X and talk about Y"
  * If we want to organize a larger meeting with a speaker, we'll need a proper venue -- but any place that has a
    room with AV equipment should be good enough for us.
    * US-RSE might eventually be able to fund this via https://us-rse.org/community-funds/
    * RENCI will probably be free, but food isn't conveniently close by.
    * [Med Deli](https://mediterraneandeli.com/chapel-hill) has a banquet room.
    * Hillsborough Library, Carrboro Library and Chapel Hill Public Library have really nice meeting rooms.
* Topics of interest ([on Slack](https://usrse.slack.com/lists/T8ZT4PJSW/F0AHFQ727U2))
  * Round table discussions
  * Tutorials/workshops (maybe like [Software Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/))
    * AI (maybe in collaboration with [RENCI](https://renci.org/))
    * CI/CD (aimed at scientists)
    * Parallelizing software would be useful
    * TOML files instead of hardcoding parameters in the software
  * Tools/techniques/"something new I've learned"
    * How to deliver software to non-technical people
    * How do you provide instructions that are complete but not overly technical
    * How to handle different kinds of interests
  * Collaborate with other groups in our area:
    * [Research Triangle Park R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/rtp-r-user-group/)
    * [Triangle Python Group](https://www.meetup.com/tripython/)
    * Could also be a way to find new members
  * One advantage to virtual meetings is that we could attract people from across the state.
* Other ways to find potential members:
  * Share information on LinkedIn
  * University-wide postdoc mailing lists
  * RENCI/UNC employees?
  * Companies with lots of RSEs, e.g. [SAS Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_Institute) in Cary
  * Could put up fliers in Research Triangle Park, e.g. at [RTP Boxyard](https://boxyard.rtp.org/)
  * Could put up fliers at the [Chapel Hill Public Library](https://www.chapelhillpubliclibrary.org/)
  * On university campuses?
  * Collaborate with other groups or organizations in our area.
* Current plan:
  * Maybe organize 2-3 more social meetings and then try to organize something different in a few months when we have
    more members.
* Next meeting: Tuesday, March 24, 2026 from 5-7pm
  * Possible venues if in-person:
    * [RTP Boxyard](https://boxyard.rtp.org/) (Research Triangle Park)
    * [Namu Durham](https://www.yelp.com/biz/namu-durham) (Durham)
