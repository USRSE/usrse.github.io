<!-- Putting the Zoom link in the text looks ugly on the website, but it adds the Zoom link to the summary included in the downloaded event. -->
We'll meet on Zoom ([https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86736347243?pwd=VxcVga9fO3AtbTNbqxajz7IHWeoxXa.1](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86736347243?pwd=VxcVga9fO3AtbTNbqxajz7IHWeoxXa.1)).
I'm planning to stay on the Zoom until 7pm, so no worries if you're running late.
