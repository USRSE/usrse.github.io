Our **January Community Call** topic will be **Open Source: More Than a GitHub Repo** on **Thursday, January 8,** 12pm ET/11am CT/10am MT/9am PT.

Many RSEs work on open source software or are planning to make their source code open source. But what does this actually mean and entail? Is putting your code on GitHub and slapping an open source license on it enough? (Short answer: no.) How do you get others to join your project? And if you have found others, how do you steer the ship? In this month’s community call, we’ll be talking all about open source and how to successfully move an open source project forward! If you have an (open source) project, are planning one, or simply want to get involved and learn from others, come join us and share your thoughts, experiences, and ideas! We want to hear all the stories, the good, the bad, and the ugly! 

The typical structure of a community call starts with an overview of recent US-RSE updates, followed by short presentations. After the presentations we will break out into smaller groups in which we discuss the call topic. Everyone is welcome to join the discussion or just hang back and listen in. If you prefer just to listen in, that is perfectly fine, but we encourage you to share your opinions and thoughts as you feel comfortable. If you want to switch to another group, this is also fine. Just go back to the main room and let the call organizers know.
