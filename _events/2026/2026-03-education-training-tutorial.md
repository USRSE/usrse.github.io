## US-RSE Education & Training Seminar Series

US-RSE periodically presents technical talks and tutorials related to Education & Training for RSEs.

## Event

The next tutorial of the US-RSE Education & Training Seminar Series will feature Andres Rios-Tascon.
This event will take place **Tuesday, February 24th at 2-4 PM ET, 1-3 PM CT, 12-2 PM MT, 11 AM - 1 PM PT**

*Abstract*: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are essential tools for developing high-quality software since they ensure consistent testing, early detection of issues, and reliable builds and deployments. This workshop introduces participants to modern CI/CD practices using GitHub Actions. Attendees will learn how to automate build, test, and deployment workflows, simplifying the development cycle and helping maintain code quality. Through hands‑on walkthrough and a short exercise, we will explore workflow configuration, reusable actions, and some of the most important features that GitHub Actions offers. By the end of the session, participants will be able to design and implement their own CI/CD workflows for their projects.

*Learning Objectives*:
1. Learn the importance of having a CI/CD setup for their projects.
1. Learn how to set up a CI workflow to build and run tests.
1. Learn how to set up a CD workflow to deploy something (in the workshop it will be a website).

*Intended Audience*: All US-RSE members.


Attendees are expected to follow the [US-RSE Code of Conduct](https://us-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/).

### Biography
Andres is a Research Software Engineer at Princeton University, working with the Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP). He focuses on developing tools needed to tackle the challenges posed by the high volume and complexity of the data that will be collected at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN and other future HEP experiments. He obtained his PhD in Physics from Cornell University, where he developed software to study the intricate geometric spaces used in the study of String Theory.
