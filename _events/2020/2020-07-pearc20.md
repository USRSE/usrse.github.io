Join us at PEARC20 for a workshop focused on Research Software Engineers.  

The full PEARC20 conference runs July 26-31 and is virtual this year.  Information about the conference is available on the [PEARC20
conference website](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc20/).  Registration will be required for all participants.

The **Research Software Engineers Community Workshop** will be July 31st, starting a 8am PDT (Portland, OR time).  It is open to all PEARC20 registrants.  

The workshop will provide an opportunity for
research software engineers to connect and share their work.  There will be
presentations from RSEs about their software, research, projects, and groups, and about
the development of the RSE community.  There will also be discussion of challenges facing RSEs and what the community can do to help meet those challenges.

Short talks will be solicited from the community soon.
