The next community call is on September 10 11ET/10CT/9MT/8PT, the main topic of discussion is "Hiring and interviewing for RSE positions". We’ll bring together RSE hiring managers, practicing RSEs, and aspiring RSEs for an open community discussion. This is a great opportunity to leverage the US-RSE community to help both sides of the table better understand a challenging, yet important, process. Some potential topics include: What qualities are hiring managers looking for? What can RSEs do to better distinguish themselves in the process? How do RSEs want to be evaluated? What have been some good/bad interview experiences? What advice would you give to someone looking to land their dream RSE job?

Other topics are also welcome!  Bring them up on the call or on Slack.

The Zoom connection details and a link to the draft US-RSE Communications Guide is posted in the general channel on Slack.
