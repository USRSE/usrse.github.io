**Post call update:** : A summary of the call can be found [here](https://us-rse.org/2020-10-13-community-call-dei/).

The next community call is on October 8 12ET/11CT/10MT/9PT, the main topic of discussion is "US-RSE's role in promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion". 

Some specific items it would be interesting to discuss are:
  - What sort of explicit statements about diversity, equity, inclusion and community values might we want to include in the US-RSE mission description?
  - What role might US-RSE take in promoting diversity within our profession, both within the US-RSE community and organization itself as it grows and also beyond within the field as a whole?
  - Are there initiatives that US-RSE could take action on now and or initiatives that could be viewed as aspirational for the future?

Other topics are also welcome!  Bring them up on the call or on Slack.

The Zoom connection details are posted in the general channel on Slack.
