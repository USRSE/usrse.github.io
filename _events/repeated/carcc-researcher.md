*Reoccurring monthly: Second Thursday of the month, 1pm ET*

Do you help researchers using IT tools to further their research goals?  Are you involved in research computing and/or data science training?  Do you consult with researchers on more effectively doing their research with advanced computing resources? Compute with data?

The Researcher-Facing Track of the [CaRCC People Network](https://carcc.org/people-network/) brings together people from research computing groups, libraries, research institutes, and other organizations who support researchers in every phase of the research lifecycle. 

Topics include:

* Research computing facilitation
* Outreach to all disciplines, esp. those under-represented, to aid with research computing resources
* Education and training
* The art and practice of facilitation
* Increasing communications, collaborations, and team-building
* Research computing UX and user-facing tech
* And more, as determined by our members!

See the [Track page](https://carcc.org/people-network/researcher-facing-track/) for upcoming call topics and connection instructions.
