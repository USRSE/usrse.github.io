The US-RSE community calls of each odd month (Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep, Nov) take place on the second Thursday of the month, 12:00-1:00pm ET on Zoom. Community call topics, agenda, and zoom registration announcements are posted to Slack and sent to the US-RSE email list.

Community calls typically have a topical focus. They provide a forum for US-RSE members to compare experiences around a topic, hang-out and chat on zoom.

Community calls alternate between the second Thursday (12:00-1:00pm ET) of each odd month and second Friday (2:00-3:00pm ET) of each even month. 

Any and all suggestions for topics are
welcome at [https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues).
Anyone in US-RSE is super welcome to lead a call on a topic of their choosing. Feel free to reach out to the organizers (currently Julia Damerow and
Abbey Roelofs) on US-RSE Slack ( "@Julia Damerow" and/or "@Abbey Roelofs") or elsewhere if you would like to host (or help with) a call.
