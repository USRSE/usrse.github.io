The USRSE monthly community calls occur on the second Thursday of each month. 12:00-13:00 Eastern. Community call topics, agenda and zoom registration
announcements are posted to Slack and sent to USRSE email accounts. 

Community calls typically have a topical focus. They provide a forum for USRSE members
to compare experiences around a topic, hang-out and chat on zoom.

Any and all suggestions for topics are 
welcome at [https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues](https://github.com/USRSE/monthly-community-calls/issues).
Anyone in USRSE is super welcome to lead a call on a topic of their choosing. Feel free to reach out to the organizers (currently Julia Damerow and
Chris Hill) on USRSE slack ( "@Julia Damerow" and/or "@Chris Hill") or elsewhere if you would like to host (or help with) a call.
