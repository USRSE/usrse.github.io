<h2>What is a Working Group?</h2>

A working group addresses an unmet need or open question broadly across the US-RSE
community. Unlike an affinity group, a working group must have a work product,
deliverable, or specific goal, such as a report or a task that it performs. A working
group may start with a need or problem and may or may not have specifically determined
deliverables at the onset, but it should be something the community is large enough to
support with a specific goal in mind.

<h2>How do I join a Working Group?</h2>

All the working groups have Slack channels, main points of contact, and/or email
addresses. Look through the list below and view their pages for more details!

<h2>How do I make a new Working Group?</h2>

If you see an unmet need that a current working group is not addressing, we invite
you to make your own! The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/group-management/">Group Management Working Group</a>
provides a process for getting your new group set up, including all of the infrastructure
to support it.

Please review the
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/group-management/form-a-working-group" target="_blank">Processes and Requirements for Forming US-RSE Working Groups</a>
page for more details!

<h2>Active Working Groups</h2>

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/dei/">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)</a></h3>

The US-RSE Association is committed to providing an inclusive environment with
equitable treatment for all and to promoting and encouraging diversity
throughout the RSE community in the US. At US-RSE, integrating DEI practices
into our education programs, governance structure, and culture is at the
forefront of our mission to ensure a welcoming, nurturing, and robustly
inclusive community. We believe that the amplification of diverse perspectives
is essential for driving innovation, promoting creativity, and encouraging
engagement for the success of RSEs. We welcome and respect individuals of
any race, color, caste, economic status, gender expression, gender identity,
sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, national origin, and ethnicity.
To get involved, visit the `#wg-diversity-equity-inclusion` channel on the US-RSE slack, or
contact the <a href="mailto:wg-dei@us-rse.org">DEI working group list</a>.

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/education_training/">Education &amp; Training</a></h3>

The Education & Training working group is for those who are interested in
regular discussions about education and training for RSEs. The goal of the
group is to develop resources and strategies that support RSE education and
training and contribute to the establishment of a more formal career path for
RSEs. Thus far, we have begun describing the types of people who work as RSEs
and their training needs. We are also working on defining the list of skills
often needed by RSEs. Furthermore, weâ€™ve begun to assemble a list of resources
for the US-RSE community, including a growing list of useful training links.
The group currently meets monthly via Zoom and welcomes all newcomers.
If you would like to join the conversation, please join the
`#wg-education_training` channel on the US-RSE Slack.

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/mentorship-program/">Mentorship Program</a></h3>

The US-RSE Mentorship Program aims to create and sustain an inter-institutional
program dedicated to promoting mentorship among research software engineers
within US-RSE. By actively exploring and developing effective strategies, we
aim to create an inclusive and supportive environment that enables the growth
and development of both mentees and mentors across institutions. Through our
collaborative efforts, we seek to enhance the professional skills and career
advancement opportunities for research software engineers, ultimately
strengthening the research software engineering community as a whole.

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/outreach/">Outreach</a></h3>

The Outreach working group aims to broaden the reach of the US-RSE Association
and the understanding and recognition of RSE as a professional designation. To
reach this goal, we plan to expand the US-RSE presence at conferences and
workshops, engage with students earlier in their educational careers, and
provide tools and resources that individual US-RSE members can easily use to
spread the message and mission of the US-RSE Association. We welcome all who
are interested in helping us with this goal. To get involved,
visit the [`#wg-outreach`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/wg-outreach) channel on

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/rse-empowerment-national-labs/">RSE Empowerment in National Labs</a></h3>

The RSE Empowerment in National Labs working group, conceptualized in 2022, is for those
who are interested in working towards the empowerment of RSEs in national labs and other similar organizations.
RSEs from national labs are an important part of the RSE community in the United States.
The goal of this working group is to understand the specific challenges faced by RSEs
in this ecosystem, advocate the goals and mission of US-RSE, assimilate resources that
help us educate and train RSEs, increase RSE awareness across the entire spectrum, and
create a community and sense of belonging among the RSEs at National Labs.
If you would like to join the conversation, please join us on
the [`#wg-national-labs-empowerment`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/wg-national-labs-empowerment)
channel on the US-RSE slack or contact us on the
