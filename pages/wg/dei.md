# Overview

The US-RSE Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) working group is dedicated to supporting DEI through education, outreach, and more as described in [our mission statement]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/dei-mission). Those interested in contributing to this goal are encouraged to join in our bi-weekly Zoom meetings.

To get involved with the DEI working group, visit the [`#dei-discussion`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/dei-discussion) channel on the US-RSE slack, or contact the <a href="mailto:dei_wg@us-rse.org">DEI working group list</a>.


# Work Products

The US-RSE DEI working group has produced and hosts the following documents and events.

## DEI Mission Statement

The US-RSE DEI working group's first large initiative was to create a US-RSE DEI Mission Statement to integrate into the US-RSE core values. This DEI Mission Statement was published in August 2021 on the [DEI Mission Statement page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/dei-mission). We expect this mission statement to evolve and mature as the US-RSE community grows and welcome feedback.

## DEI Speaker Series

The US-RSE DEI working group invites DEI speakers to present on DEI topics. In 2021, we hosted [Dr. Cherri Pancake]({{ site.url }}/events/2021/2021-03-dei-speaker-series/) as she presented her talk, "Can We Change the Face of Computing?" and [Joanne Esch and Andrea Bowen-Jones]({{ site.url }}/events/2021/2021-07-dei-speaker-series-ncwit) of the National Center for Women & Information Technology.

We will continue to invite and host speakers as they are available. We welcome suggestions regarding potential speakers.

## DEI Media Club

The US-RSE DEI working group hosts monthly DEI Media Club discussions in which we invite participants to read, listen to, or watch the chosen monthly DEI media and come ready to discuss the content as a small group. In 2021, we hosted three sessions to discuss the book "Better Allies" by Karen Catlin and two Podcast sessions to discuss series 4, episode 6 of [reWorked - The Diversity and Inclusion Podcast](https://theewgroup.com/podcast/) and [Code Switch - The Folk Devil Made Me Do It](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/20/1029775224/the-folk-devil-made-me-do-it).

These are announced via the [`#events`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/events) and [`#dei-discussion`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/dei-discussion) channels on the US-RSE slack, as well as in monthly newsletters, and are hosted virtually via Zoom.

## US-RSE Spanish Webpage Translation

The US-RSE DEI working group is spearheading an effort to translate the US-RSE webpage into Spanish in order to broaden accessibility to a wider audience. This is an ongoing effort. To get involved, visit the [`#dei-discussion`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/dei-discussion) channel on the US-RSE slack.

## RSE Mentorship

In 2022, the US-RSE DEI working group will begin an effort to promote and support mentorship in the RSE community. We welcome suggestions on how to get this effort started and where we would make the most impact.
