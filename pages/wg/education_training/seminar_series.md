The Education and Training Seminar Series is a series of technical talks and tutorials presented by leading researchers and practitioners in the field of research software engineering.
The talks cover a wide range of topics, including software development best practices, software engineering for scientific computing, and research software management.
The tutorials provide hands-on instruction on how to use specific software tools and technologies.
This seminar series is a great opportunity to learn about the latest advances in research software engineering and to network with other researchers and practitioners in the field.
Other resources for learning about research software engineering include the [US-RSE Training Resources](https://us-rse.org/wg/education_training/training/)
