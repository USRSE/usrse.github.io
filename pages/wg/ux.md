# Overview

The User Experience Working Group (UXWG) advocates for increased awareness and
adoption of user experience (UX) methods in research software engineering. UX
practices help create products that provide meaningful, relevant, and usable
experiences for target users. Our primary aims are to share knowledge, experiences,
and challenges and to foster a diverse and inclusive community for research
software UX practitioners and RSEs who are interested in UX. Doing so will
collectively help us advocate for and demystify UX to the larger RSE
community, scientists across domains, and funding agency staff who support
products and services. The UX working group will aim to first develop a
community of practice with webinars on UX in science and networking among
participants. We will work with members to explore other outcomes such as
producing a US-RSE Community Whitepaper to address UX topics such as common
R&D methods, opportunities for increased visibility and work (including
surfacing and tracking the impacts of UX on improving scientific software
products), and the challenges of adapting commercial UX practices to
scientific environments.

The working group meets on the 3rd Thursday of the month at 4pm Eastern and 
welcomes asynchronous participation from people who are unable to join those meetings.
