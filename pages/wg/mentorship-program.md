# Overview

The US-RSE Mentorship Program aims to create and sustain an inter-institutional
program dedicated to promoting mentorship among research software engineers
within US-RSE. By actively exploring and developing effective strategies, we
aim to create an inclusive and supportive environment that enables the growth
and development of both mentees and mentors across institutions. Through our
collaborative efforts, we seek to enhance the professional skills and career
advancement opportunities for research software engineers, ultimately
strengthening the research software engineering community as a whole.

To get involved, visit the

on the US-RSE slack.

**Co-Chairs**: Daniel Shown, Reed Milewicz
