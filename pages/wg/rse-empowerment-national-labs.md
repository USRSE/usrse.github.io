# Overview

The RSE Empowerment in National Labs working group, conceptualized in 2022, is for those who are
interested in working towards the empowerment of RSEs in national labs and other similar
organizations.  RSEs from national labs are an important part of the RSE community in the United
States.  The goal of this working group is to understand the specific challenges faced by RSEs in
this ecosystem, advocate the goals and mission of US-RSE, assimilate resources that help us educate
and train RSEs, increase RSE awareness across the entire spectrum, and create a community and sense
of belonging among the RSEs at National Labs.

We generally meet monthly via zoom to discuss various topics and share experiences with ongoing
discussions via Slack.
