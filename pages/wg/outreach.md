# Overview

The US-RSE Outreach Working Group is dedicated to broadening the US-RSE's engagement with the RSE and wider computationl science and engineering (CSE) communities. We strive to raise awareness of the US-RSE as an association and RSE as a professional designation through engagement with industry, academia, national labs, and students.

Those interested in contributing to this goal are encouraged to join our bi-weekly Teams meetings. To get involved, visit the [`#outreach`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/outreach) channel on the US-RSE slack or contact the <a href="mailto:outreach_wg@us-rse.org">Outreach working group list</a>.
