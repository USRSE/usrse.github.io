# Overview

The US-RSE Outreach Working Group is dedicated to broadening the US-RSE's
engagement with the RSE and wider computationl science and engineering (CSE)
communities. We strive to raise awareness of the US-RSE as an association and
RSE as a professional designation through engagement with industry, academia,
national labs, and students.

Those interested in contributing to this goal are encouraged to join our
bi-weekly Teams meetings. To get involved, visit the
[`#outreach`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/outreach) channel on the US-RSE
slack or contact the
<a href="mailto:outreach_wg@us-rse.org">Outreach working group list</a>.

# Work Products

The US-RSE Outreach working group is new as of 2022. The following events were
either completed before the creation of the official working group or are
initiatives for future work.

## Existing Efforts

### RSE Stories

Created by Vanessa Sochat, the [RSE Stories podcast](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories/)
aims to cast a spotlight on the differing backgrounds and paths professionals
have taken to become RSEs and help shape our understanding of what an RSE really is.

The podcast has existed since 2019 and is looking for more volunteers both as
interviewees and production.

### Conference and Workshop Participation

The US-RSE has had a presence at several conferences and workshops throughout
its lifetime. For example:

- Supercomputing 2021: RSE-in-HPC Workshop, Student Program Orientation
- PEARC21: RSE Career Panel
- Supercomputing 2020: RSE-in-HPC Workshop
- PEARC20: Research Software Engineers Community Workshop
- PEARC19: Building a Community of Research Software Engineers Birds of a Feather
- EDUCAUSE 2019: Supporting Research Software and Research Software Engineers Poster

### External Collaboration

The US-RSE has collaborated with other organizations in the past for events
such as the Early Career Panel (Academic Data Science Alliance).

## Future Directions

### Conference and Workshop Participation

The US-RSE will continue to engage in conferences and workshops. We aim to
broaden our presence at previously unrepresented conferences to include
domain-specific conferences and general technical conferences.

Towards this goal, the Outreach working group is putting together a call for
volunteers for a SciPy Birds of a Feather RSE panel. If you are interested in
participating as a panel member, please fill out
[this form](https://forms.gle/PUcfcD7LnKVXnZfJ8).

### Customizable RSE Introduction Template

Many members of the US-RSE have spoken in diverse environments to a variety of
audiences about the US-RSE. There has been no standardized presentation or
template for ad-hoc events such as these.

To address this gap, the Outreach working group
aims to create a "Ad-hoc US-RSE Overview Template" that is customizable for
different audiences but provides a basic set of standardized content.

### Career Counseling

As Research Software Engineering is still a relatively new professional
designation, the Outreach working group would like to broaden awareness of
paths that lead to RSEs throughout colleges and high schools.

We aim to create connections with career counseling programs and provide
resources about what RSEs are and how to become an RSE such that the younger
generation is introduced to the concept sooner in their educational careers.
