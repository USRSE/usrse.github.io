# Overview

The US-RSE Outreach Working Group is dedicated to broadening US-RSE's
engagement with the research software engineer (RSE) and wider computational
science and engineering (CSE) communities. We strive to raise awareness of
US-RSE as an association and RSE as a professional designation through
engagement with industry, academia, national labs, and students.

Those interested in contributing to this goal are encouraged to join our
bi-weekly virtual meetings. To get involved, visit the
[`#wg-outreach`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/wg-outreach) channel on the US-RSE
slack or contact the
<a href="mailto:wg-outreach@us-rse.org">Outreach working group list</a>.

**Co-chairs**: Miranda Mundt, Joshua Teves

# Work Products

The official US-RSE Outreach working group began in 2022. The group has produced
and hosts the following media, documents, and events.

## Developer Stories

Created by Vanessa Sochat, the [Developer Stories podcast](https://rseng.github.io/devstories/)
aims to cast a spotlight on the differing backgrounds and paths professionals
have taken.

The podcast has existed since September 2019 and is looking for more volunteers
for interviewees, hosts, and audio editors.

## Speaker Series

We are participating in or spearheading two different speaker series, starting
in late 2022.

### <a name="funder-series">Funder Series</a>

A subgroup of the US-RSE Outreach Working Group is organizing a Funder Series,
a speaker series aimed at bringing representatives from funders (e.g., NSF, NIH)
to speak to members of US-RSE. These funders will bring essential information
about opportunities, strategies, and starting points for finding funding.

#### Upcoming Presentations

- __2023-05-09 Carly Strasser__ - Chan Zuckerberg Initiative: [Event info and registration]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/2023/2023-05-funder-talk-series/)

- __2023-06-20 Varun Chandola__ - National Science Foundation: [Event info and registration]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/2023/2023-06-funder-talk-series/)

Please keep an eye out for future announcements regarding this series.

### Supercomputing Spotlights

The SIAM Activity Group on Supercomputing (SIAG/SC) is starting a webinar
series entitled Supercomputing Spotlights to inspire the next generation of
students. The webinar features short TED-style presentations that highlight the
impact and successes of high-performance computing (HPC).
Initial info about the series is available via [https://siag-sc.org](https://siag-sc.org).

US-RSE was asked if they would be interested, in addition to other
international members of the RSE community, in exploring the concept of
co-sponsoring a session in this series. SIAM/SC is pausing the series during
the northern summer and plans to resume in the northern fall, aiming for
monthly cadence with regular RSE/SC occurrences.

We are aiming to create a small international RSE group to work on this that
would suggest and work with potential speakers for these quarterly sessions
(where the other monthly sessions would not be this group's responsibility).

Please keep an eye out for future announcements regarding this series.

## SWAG Giveaways

In August 2022, the Outreach Working Group hosted the first ever
US-RSE Free SWAG Giveaway. This giveaway was available and open to all US-RSE
members.

![US-RSE Swag Options](/assets/img/us_rse_swag_giveaway.png)

28 winners were selected to receive tumblers and backpacks, and all entrants
were sent official US-RSE stickers.

## Outreach Material Cultivation

Many US-RSE members have already conducted outreach as part of their daily lives.
To promote reusability, the Outreach Working Group has created a
[US-RSE Outreach Materials Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gu_0fhAZt7jjrDFWTHekyRLBboCZUnc8)
where anyone can submit their materials, articles, blog posts, etc., for use
and reference by other US-RSE members.

Please submit your own content in the appropriate folder and list it in the
[main manifest document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TOl1ApTvzKXeuO38ZSsrShNXN1uTU9AgetlFMJexKuk/edit?usp=sharing)!

------

## Rapid Interviews

We are actively recruiting US-RSE members to submit short self-recorded interviews
for use on our [website](https://us-rse.org) and at other events, such as Supercomputing 2022.

We will send some free swag to those who participate in this! You can choose
from either a US-RSE official sticker or lapel pin.

We ask that interested members answer a short series of questions, including:

- Tell us about you - where do you live, where do you work, what are your interests, what do you currently work on?
- What are you working on right now that is exciting?
- How did you hear about RSEs and US-RSE?
- Why did you join US-RSE?
- Describe your work as an RSE or RSE ally in one sentence.
- Where would you like to see the RSE profession in 10 years?

If you are interested in submitting a rapid interview, please refer to our
[instruction guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q_D1mf8h5ryqy4y73j16g2-HY7wp-pBsIQj7O6k9u4s/edit?usp=sharing).
