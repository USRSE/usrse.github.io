# Overview

The US-RSE Outreach Working Group is dedicated to broadening the US-RSE's
engagement with the research software engineer (RSE) and wider computational
science and engineering (CSE) communities. We strive to raise awareness of
US-RSE as an association and RSE as a professional designation through
engagement with industry, academia, national labs, and students.

Those interested in contributing to this goal are encouraged to join our
bi-weekly virtual meetings. To get involved, visit the
[`#wg-outreach`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/wg-outreach) channel on the US-RSE
slack or contact the
<a href="mailto:wg-outreach@us-rse.org">Outreach working group list</a>.

**Chair**: Miranda Mundt
**Co-chair**: Joshua Teves

# Work Products

The official US-RSE Outreach working group began in 2022. The group has produced
and hosts the following media, documents, and events.

## RSE Stories

Created by Vanessa Sochat, the [RSE Stories podcast](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories/)
aims to cast a spotlight on the differing backgrounds and paths professionals
have taken to become RSEs and help shape our understanding of what an RSE really is.

The podcast has existed since September 2019 and is looking for more volunteers
both for interviewees and hosts.

## Conference/Workshop Participation and Organization

US-RSE has had a presence at several conferences and workshops throughout
its lifetime and continues to find new venues. A non-exhaustive list of

## Speaker Series

We are participating in or spear-heading two different speaker series, starting
in late 2022.

### Funder Series

### Supercomputing Spotlights

## SWAG Giveaways



## Outreach Material Cultivation

Many US-RSE members have already conducted outreach as part of their daily lives.
To promote reusability, the Outreach Working Group has created a
[US-RSE Outreach Materials Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gu_0fhAZt7jjrDFWTHekyRLBboCZUnc8)
where anyone can submit their materials, articles, blog posts, etc., for use
and reference by other US-RSE members.

Please submit your own content in the appropriate folder and list it in the
[main manifest document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TOl1ApTvzKXeuO38ZSsrShNXN1uTU9AgetlFMJexKuk/edit?usp=sharing)!

## Rapid Interviews

We are actively recruiting US-RSE members to submit short self-recorded interviews
for use on our [website](https://us-rse.org) and at other events, such as Supercomputing 2022.

We ask that interested members answer a short series of questions, including:

- Tell us about you - where do you live, where do you work, what are your interests, what do you currently work on?
- What are you working on right now that is exciting?
- How did you hear about RSEs and the US-RSE?
- Why did you join the US-RSE?
- Describe your work as an RSE or RSE ally in one sentence.
- Where would you like to see the RSE profession in 10 years?

If you are interested in submitting a rapid interview, please refer to our
[instruction guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q_D1mf8h5ryqy4y73j16g2-HY7wp-pBsIQj7O6k9u4s/edit?usp=sharing).
