# Overview

The Testing Working Group aims to bring together RSEs, researchers, and practitioners
to discuss current limitations in testing research software, share knowledge, and collectively
address cutting-edge challenges, thereby advancing the reliability and quality of research
software. This will include examining, adapting, and using valuable industry software testing
practices and methodologies, as well as studying and harnessing AI technologies. Some key
focus areas include testing legacy code, ensuring comprehensive code coverage, and enhancing
overall verification and validation processes.

If you would like to join the conversation, please join us on
the [`#wg-testing`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/wg-testing)
channel on the US-RSE slack or contact us on the
<a href="mailto:wg-testing@us-rse.org">Testing working group list</a>. 

**Co-Chairs**: Nasir Eisty, David Luet
