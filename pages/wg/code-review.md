# Overview

This working group grew out of a BoF at the US-RSE conference. The chairs,
listed below, were two of the panelists in the BoF Discussion. It was evident
from the discussion that there was a strong desire to continue this discussion
beyond the BoF. 

The goal of this working group is to build a community of RSEs who are
interested in code review. The working group will provide a forum to gather
resources related to code review, discuss the use of code review in research
software project, and seek help in conducting code reviews. 

To get involved, visit the
[`#wg-code-review`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/wg-code-review) channel
on the US-RSE slack.

**Co-Chairs**: Jeffrey Carver, Alex Koufos, Abbey Roelofs
