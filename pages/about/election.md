## Positions and Eligibility

Four Steering Committee seats are open in this election, each for a 2-year term (January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024). The following steering committee members have terms that end this year: Julia Damerow, Chris Hill, Daniel S. Katz, Lance Parsons. All US-RSE members in good standing as of the day nominations open (October 24, 2022) are eligible for nomination.

A membership verification email will be sent to all members in October. The message will be sent directly from leadership@us-rse.org, not through the Google group used for most email communications.   Individuals who do not receive the membership verification email may join the organization by filling out the membership form at [https://us-rse.org/join/](https://us-rse.org/join/).  For questions or help with membership matters, please contact Election Chair Christina Maimone on Slack or [via email](mailto:christina.maimone@northwestern.edu).

The US-RSE Steering Committee sets its own meeting frequency and timing.  Currently, the Steering Committee meets every two weeks on Fridays.  The Steering Committee meeting frequency and schedule for 2023 will be determined once new members are elected.

The responsibilities of Steering Committee members are detailed in the [US-RSE Membership and Governance](https://github.com/USRSE/documents/blob/master/governance.md) document. They include:

* Setting the overall policy and direction of the US-RSE Association
* Being responsible for day-to-day activities, operations, and development of the US-RSE Association

Additionally, Steering Committee members are expected to:

* Attend and participate in Steering Committee meetings

## Candidate Meeting

For the 2022 election, we are planning a meeting of all of the candidates before names are released publicly.  This will be an opportunity for candidates to learn who else is running and discuss how they want to share information about themselves during the Annual General Meeting.  

## Voting

If there are more candidates than seats available, an election will be held.  

Elections will be run through
https://electionbuddy.com.  US-RSE members' email
addresses will be shared with this site for the sole purpose of voting.  Each
US-RSE member as of November 20, 2022, gets one ballot with the voting rule of
[single transferable vote
(STV)](https://electionbuddy.com/features/voting-systems/stv-voting).  This
voting rule asks each voter to rank the candidates, and seats are allocated
across candidates using this ranking information.  

The results of the election are valid regardless of the turnout rate for the
election.
