The following steering committee members have terms that end this year: Jeff Carver, Ian Cosden, Charles Ferenbaugh, Sandra Gesing, and Christina Maimone. All US-RSE members in good standing as of the day nominations open (October 22, 2021) are eligible for nomination.

A membership verification email will be sent to all members in October. The message will be sent directly from leadership@us-rse.org, not through the Google group used for most email communications.   Individuals who do not receive the membership verification email may join the organization by filling out the membership form at [https://us-rse.org/join/](https://us-rse.org/join/).  For questions or help with membership matters, please contact Election Chairs Julia Damerow and Lance Parsons on Slack or [via email](mailto:jdamerow@asu.edu,lparsons@princeton.edu).

The US-RSE Steering Committee sets its own meeting frequency and timing.  Currently, the Steering Committee meets every two weeks.  The Steering Committee meeting frequency and schedule for 2022 will be determined once new members are elected.

## Voting

addresses will be shared with this site for the sole purpose of voting.  Each
US-RSE member as of November 19, 2021, gets one ballot with the voting rule of
[single transferable vote
(STV)](https://electionbuddy.com/features/voting-systems/stv-voting).  This
voting rule asks each voter to rank the candidates, and seats are allocated
across candidates using this ranking information.  

The results of the election are valid regardless of the turnout rate for the
election.
