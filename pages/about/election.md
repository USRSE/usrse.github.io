## Nominations and Candidate Information

<!-- **[Candidate Information is Available](/2022-11-18-sc-candidates/)** -->

Nominations open on October 13, 2023 and close on October 27, 2023. 

Once nominations open up, interested members are encouraged to nominate themselves.
Alternatively, if you know of a member who you think would make a good
candidate, you can submit a nomination 
for someone else, who will be invited to run.  All US-RSE members in good standing are eligible to be nominated as candidates.

<!-- **Nomination Form**

The nomination form can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJcBNhvT0qDGwXgM5qsRbonVQ9TVsutacupXBl_7NJz2zTcw/viewform). Please fill this form for self-nomination OR if you are nominating someone else.

On the nomination form, expect to provide the following information

**If Nominating Someone Else:**
* Your name and email
* Nominee's name and email
* Short statement about why you think the nominated individual will make a good Steering Committee member

Nominations of others will only be shared with the Election Chair and the
nominated individual. The Election Chair will contact the nominated individual
to let them know they were nominated, and by whom, and to confirm their
interest in participating. The information will not be made public.

All candidate information will be shared on the US-RSE website.  Additionally, candidates will have a chance to share information about themselves at the Annual General Meeting on December 1, 2023.

An [#election channel is available on Slack](https://usrse.slack.com/archives/C01BC66Q16E) for any discussion with or about candidates.

## Candidate Meeting

For the 2023 election, we are planning a meeting of all of the candidates before names are released publicly.  This will be an opportunity for candidates to learn who else is running and discuss how they want to share information about themselves during the Annual General Meeting.  

## Voting

If there are more candidates than seats available, an election will be held.  

Elections will be run through
https://electionbuddy.com.  US-RSE members' email
addresses will be shared with this site for the sole purpose of voting.  Each
US-RSE member as of November 8, 2023, gets one ballot with the voting rule of
[single transferable vote
(STV)](https://electionbuddy.com/features/voting-systems/stv-voting).  This
voting rule asks each voter to rank the candidates, and seats are allocated
across candidates using this ranking information.  

The results of the election are valid regardless of the turnout rate for the
election.
