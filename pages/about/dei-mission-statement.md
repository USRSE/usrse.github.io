#### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at US-RSE

The US-RSE Association is committed to providing an [inclusive environment with
equitable treatment]({{ site.baseurl }}/code-of-conduct/) for all and to promoting
and encouraging diversity throughout the RSE community in the US. At US-RSE,
integrating DEI practices into our education programs, governance structure,
and culture is at the forefront of our mission to ensure a welcoming,
nurturing, and robustly inclusive community. We believe that the amplification
of diverse perspectives is essential for driving innovation, promoting
creativity, and encouraging engagement for the success of RSEs. We welcome and
respect individuals of all dimensions of diversity, including but not limited
to race, color, caste, economic status, gender expression, gender identity,
sexual orientation, disability, neurocognitive differences, age,
religion (or lack thereof), national origin, and ethnicity.

The US-RSE Association will:
- Continually educate ourselves through research on best practices focused on
  diversity, equity, and inclusion
- Embrace the culture and diversity of all our members
- Welcome and respect ways of thinking and learning from people of all
  backgrounds
- Seek to make our membership and the RSE community in the US more broadly
  representative of our national population
- Strive to reduce biases, both conscious and unconscious, and work to
  eliminate systemic discrimination and marginalization
- Provide resources for community members interested in learning more about DEI
- Engage with other community-based DEI initiatives
- Approach every situation and person with empathy
- Embrace the culture and diversity of all our members by listening to
  "uncomfortable truths" and having the courage to act on what we have learned
