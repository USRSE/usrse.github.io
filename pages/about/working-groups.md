<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/dei/">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)</a></h3>

The US-RSE Association is committed to providing an inclusive environment with
equitable treatment for all and to promoting and encouraging diversity
throughout the RSE community in the US. At US-RSE, integrating DEI practices
into our education programs, governance structure, and culture is at the
forefront of our mission to ensure a welcoming, nurturing, and robustly
inclusive community. We believe that the amplification of diverse perspectives
is essential for driving innovation, promoting creativity, and encouraging
engagement for the success of RSEs. We welcome and respect individuals of
any race, color, caste, economic status, gender expression, gender identity,
sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, national origin, and ethnicity.
To get involved, visit the `#dei-discussion` channel on the US-RSE slack, or
contact the <a href="mailto:wg-dei@us-rse.org">DEI working group list</a>.

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/website/">Website</a></h3>

The US-RSE website working group assembled in late 2020/2021 to proactively
work on the content and design of the US-RSE website.

If you are interested in working on the site, or want to suggest features or a
better design, you can join the `#website` channel on the US-RSE slack,
or jump right in and start a discussion on the
<a href="https://github.com/usrse/usrse.github.io/issues">GitHub issues board</a>.

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/education_training/">Education &amp; Training</a></h3>

The Education & Training working group is for those who are interested in
regular discussions about education and training for RSEs. The goal of the
group is to develop resources and strategies that support RSE education and
training and contribute to the establishment of a more formal career path for
RSEs. Thus far, we have begun describing the types of people who work as RSEs
and their training needs. We are also working on defining the list of skills
often needed by RSEs. Furthermore, we’ve begun to assemble a list of resources
for the US-RSE community, including a growing list of useful training links.
The group currently meets monthly via Zoom and welcomes all newcomers.
If you would like to join the conversation, please join the
`#education-training` channel on the US-RSE Slack.

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wg/outreach/">Outreach</a></h3>

The Outreach working group aims to broaden the reach of the US-RSE Association
and the understanding and recognition of RSE as a professional designation. To
reach this goal, we plan to expand the US-RSE presence at conferences and
workshops, engage with students earlier in their educational careers, and
provide tools and resources that individual US-RSE members can easily use to
spread the message and mission of the US-RSE Association. We welcome all who
are interested in helping us with this goal. To get involved,
visit the [`#wg-outreach`](https://usrse.slack.com/messages/wg-outreach) channel on
the US-RSE slack or contact the
<a href="mailto:wg-outreach@us-rse.org">Outreach working group list</a>.

Visit the [Outreach Working Group page]({{ site.baseurl }}/wg/outreach/) for
more details and a catalog of work products.
