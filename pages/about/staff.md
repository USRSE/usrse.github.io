### Message from the Executive Director December 2025

Dear US-RSE Members and Allies,

As we reach the end of 2025, I am grateful for the strength, generosity, and momentum of the US-RSE community. Now numbering over 3,700 members, this community continues to show that progress is built through collaboration, care, and a shared commitment to improving research through better software. This year reminded many of us that progress can be challenging under uncertainty, and the community continued to show up for each other with practical help, thoughtful questions, and steady engagement.

One of the key milestones this year has been the formation and engagement of our Organizational Founding Members. Your partnership is helping US-RSE grow from a strong grassroots network into a durable, long-term organization, while remaining firmly rooted in its community. This growth strengthens our ability to serve members, expand programming, and elevate research software engineering across institutions, disciplines, and career stages.

We are also deeply grateful for the continued support of major funding partners, including the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and Schmidt Sciences. Their sustained investment has been critical in enabling US-RSE to grow its capacity, strengthen its operations, and support the community in meaningful ways.

Our sense of community was especially evident at the US-RSE conference in Philadelphia, which brought together more than 280 participants for conversations, knowledge sharing, and connections across institutions and career stages. The energy, openness, and generosity of that gathering reflected the best of what US-RSE stands for and continues to motivate our work throughout the year.

I also want to express my sincere thanks to our Steering Committee. Your time, care, and leadership continue to shape US-RSE in ways that members can feel. This includes governance, strategic direction, and thoughtful decision-making, as well as providing stability and clarity when it is most needed. I am also grateful to the many volunteers and working group contributors whose time and expertise quietly power much of what US-RSE is able to do.

Community building and education continue to be core parts of our work, among several areas of focus. One highlight this year was our webinar series with Reach The World, designed for K12 classrooms to introduce students to supercomputing, research software, and the future of AI. These sessions reached over 900 students across 46 classrooms, with continued engagement through more than 1,390 YouTube views. Seeing young learners connect with research software concepts reinforces why visibility, outreach, and clear pathways into our field matter so much.

Looking ahead, we will continue focusing on career recognition, strengthening partnerships, and sustainable growth, while staying grounded in what this community needs most. This includes connection, practical resources, and a strong sense of belonging for RSEs wherever they are. I am excited about what we will build together in 2026 and deeply thankful to everyone who contributed time, ideas, encouragement, and energy this year. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I value your ideas, questions, and feedback, and I am always glad to hear from you.

Wishing you a restful holiday season and a happy, healthy New Year.

Warm regards,
Sandra Gesing
Executive Director, US-RSE

### Message from the Executive Director December 2024

Dear US-RSE Members and Allies,

As this year ends, I’m filled with gratitude and pride for the incredible progress our vibrant US-RSE community has made. With over 3,000 members and the success of our second in-person US-RSE conference, we have strengthened our space for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual support. This event highlighted the power of a community where individuals from diverse career paths and backgrounds come together with a shared sense of purpose.

This year brought many key milestones. Continued funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has been important in solidifying our operational foundation. The launch of our Organizational Membership Program is an exciting step toward financial sustainability, fostering deeper partnerships and expanding recognition for RSEs within the research ecosystem.

Reflecting on the past year, the uncharted waters I faced as your Executive Director no longer feel so unknown, thanks to the incredible support of this community. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Steering Committee, whose dedication and hands-on contributions have been crucial to our growth and success. I’m equally thankful for the strong support of our members, my advisory board, and mentors, whose guidance and encouragement have made this journey possible.

Looking ahead, advocacy, funding, and the sustainability of US-RSE remain focal points of my work. The Steering Committee and I are committed to advancing professional development, career recognition, and innovative programs for both current and future RSEs. Globally, US-RSE continues to strengthen ties with international RSE communities, reminding us that we are part of a worldwide movement to elevate the visibility and impact of RSEs. Together, we are stronger.

As we enter the holiday season, I hope you find time to rest, recharge, and celebrate. Thank you for being part of this extraordinary journey—I’m always grateful for your ideas and input, so please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Wishing you a joyful holiday season and a happy, healthy New Year!

Warm regards,
Sandra Gesing


### Message from the Executive Director October 2023

Dear US-RSE members and allies,
 
I’m honored and thrilled to be appointed the inaugural Executive Director of US-RSE. My whole work life has been 
immersed around software with me starting already at high-school with programming. I enjoyed working in industry as 
an administrator, system developer and head of a systems programming group for over a decade and then I switched 
from industry to research completing my PhD in a bioinformatics group. I have been an RSE, research faculty and 
senior research scientist with a major focus on research software in the last 17 years. This moment is very special to me 
because it is about a community I’m incredibly passionate about, and this community feels like home. Being a part 
of it means having a space for discussions, a space for learning and support of a non-traditional career path. 
With my resume, I often felt like a unicorn – not within US-RSE though.

The last five years have shown how much we all can achieve together as a community, and we went from around 20 members 
in 2018 to nearly 2000 in 2023. US-RSE is a vibrant community evident in the activities on Slack, working groups, 
organized workshops, participation in community calls – to name just a few. Next week will be our first in-person 
conference ever and I am so impressed by the energy of contributors, organization committee members, volunteers and 
the sponsors. The conference is sold out and as a General Chair I am relieved and grateful for everyone’s patience as 
we navigated these unchartered waters.

We have more unchartered waters in front of us - with a lot of support that will kick-off our exciting journey. 
Thanks to the Alfred Sloan Foundation, we have for the first time substantial funding for community activities, grants 
and awards. Additionally, we can hire staff, which is a full-time soon-to-be-announced Community Manager and me as a 
half-time Executive Director. I am convinced that our spectacular growth of membership and volunteer work needs this 
support to keep the grass-root character of US-RSE without burning out volunteers and get measures in place that can 
facilitate innovative ideas and activities – especially also assuring the sustainability of the organization.

Much of my work will be focused on the sustainability of the organization and my vision is that we achieve financial 
sustainability with different tiers of funding and contributions. Volunteer work will stay a cornerstone of US-RSE. 
Together with the community manager I will contribute to this thriving community to address pain points and support 
activities that the community would like to accomplish. We are not alone in this journey. The world-wide movement is 
impressive with RSE associations in Africa, Australia/New Zealand, Belgium, Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, Nordic 
countries and the UK. Though at times, we may feel like unicorns, we are part of an ever-expanding, diverse and extraordinary 
community. 

I’m looking forward to this journey with you and I’m grateful for any ideas and input! Please don’t hesitate to contact me.
 
Sincerely,

Sandra Gesing
