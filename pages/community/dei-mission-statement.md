We believe Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) are core values of the
US-RSE Association. A dedicated team of active members continue to lead the
development of a DEI program for our organization. DEI discussions are and
will continue to be an integral part of our community.

The US-RSE Association is committed to providing an [inclusive environment with
equitable treatment]({{site.url}}/code-of-conduct) for all and to promoting and
encouraging diversity throughout the RSE community in the US. At US-RSE,
integrating DEI practices into our education programs, governance structure,
and culture is at the forefront of our mission to ensure a welcoming,
nurturing, and robustly inclusive community. We believe that the
amplification of diverse perspectives is essential for driving innovation,
promoting creativity, and encouraging engagement for the success of RSEs. We
welcome and respect individuals of any race, color, caste, economic status,
gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disabilities, age, religion,
national origin, and ethnicity.
