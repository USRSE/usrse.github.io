## Diversity Statement
The US-RSE Association welcomes and encourages participation in our community by people of all backgrounds and identities. We, the members
of the US-RSE Association, are committed to promoting and sustaining a culture that values mutual respect, tolerance, and learning. We work together as a community to help each other live out these values.

We have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse community is stronger, more vibrant, and produces better
software and better research. A diverse community where people treat each other with respect has more potential contributors,
more sources for ideas, and fewer shared assumptions that might hinder the achievement of our goals.

Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to make it all-inclusive, we recognize that there are specific
identities that are impacted by systemic discrimination and marginalization. We welcome all people to participate in the US-RSE
Association regardless of their identity or background.

## Introduction & Scope

This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the US-RSE community. It should be honored in any US-RSE-related
activities, by anyone claiming affiliation with US-RSE, and especially when someone is representing the US-RSE Association in any role (including as an event volunteer or speaker).

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the US-RSE Association, including all public and private mailing lists, issue
trackers, wikis, forums, code repositories, and any other communication channel used by our community. The code of conduct equally
applies at US-RSE Association events and governs standards of behavior for attendees, speakers, volunteers, booth staff, and event
sponsors.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our understanding of a collaborative, inclusive community culture. Please
try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and productive environment that enriches the US-RSE
community.

We require all US-RSE Association sponsored and affiliated projects, activities, and events, to adopt a code of conduct that encourages a productive, respectful environment for all contributors and community members. The US-RSE Association Code of Conduct follows below.

If a person is found to violate the US-RSE Association Code of Conduct, the Steering Committee may take any action they deem appropriate
to resolve the situation, including warning the person in question, removing them from a specific activity, banning them from further
participation in activities (in person or online), or expulsion from the US-RSE Association.

## Standards for Behavior

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Please always be
kind and courteous. There’s never a need to be mean, rude, or disrespectful. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly
community for all.

We, the members of US-RSE Association, strive to:

* Be empathetic, respectful, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We remember that every US-RSE event, project, and program is crafted by
human beings who deserve to be treated with kindness and empathy. We work together to resolve conflict and assume good intentions. We
may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where
people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.  
* Be collaborative. Our work depends on the participation of many people, and in turn others depend on our work. Effective and friendly collaboration enables everyone to better achieve their goals.  
* Be careful in the words that we choose. We are careful and respectful in our communication, and we take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members of the community.

## Unacceptable Behavior
We, the members of US-RSE Association, are committed to making participation in this community a harassment-free experience.

We will not accept harassment or other exclusionary behaviors, such as:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery  
* Excessive profanity (please avoid curse words; people differ greatly in their sensitivity to swearing)  
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material
* Violent or intimidating threats or language directed against another person or group
* Inappropriate physical contact and/or unwelcome sexual attention or sexual comments
* Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language
* Trolling or insulting and derogatory comments
* Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership in a specific group, including level
of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurotype, personal appearance, body size, race,
ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality
* Public or private harassment
* Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or direct message history, without the sender’s consent
* Continuing to initiate interaction (such as photography, recording, messaging, or conversation) with someone after being asked to stop
* Sustained disruption of talks, events, or communications, such as heckling of a speaker
* Publishing (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”), such as physical or electronic
addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors

## Reporting Guidelines
If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report this in a timely manner (see How to Submit a Report). Code of
conduct violations reduce the value of the community for everyone. US-RSE Association members take reports of misconduct very seriously
and are committed to preserving and maintaining the welcoming nature of our community.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. All reports will be kept confidential.

In some cases the US-RSE Leadership may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that’s the case, the identities of
all involved parties and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

For possibly unintentional breaches of the code of conduct, you may want to respond to the person and point out this code of conduct 
(either in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate). If you would prefer not to do that, please report the issue (see How to 
Submit a Report) or contact a US-RSE Association Steering Committee member for assistance.

Take care of each other. Alert the US-RSE Association Steering Committee (contact@us-rse.org) if you notice a dangerous situation, 
someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

### How to Submit a Report
If you feel your safety is in jeopardy or the situation is an emergency, contact local law enforcement before making a report to the US-RSE Association. (In the U.S., dial 911.)

The US-RSE Association is committed to promptly addressing any reported issues. If you have experienced or witnessed behavior that violates the US-RSE Association Code of Conduct, please send an email to contact@us-rse.org. These emails are sent to the US-RSE Association Steering Committee.
