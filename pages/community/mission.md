The US-RSE Association is centered around four main goals. We aim
to target our activities and actions to serving these aspects:

## 1. Community 

  We seek to provide a coherent association of those who identify with
  the role (not necessarily title) of Research Software Engineer based
  on our [inclusive definition]({{site.url}}/what-is-an-rse/).  This
  group aims to provide the members of the community the ability to
  share knowledge, professional connections, and resources.

## 2. Advocacy

  We aim to promote RSEs' impact on research, highlighting the
  increasingly critical and valuable role RSEs serve.

## 3. Resources 

  We strive to provide useful resources to multiple demographics.
  For current and future RSEs we strive to provide technical and
  career development resources to support their professional
  development.  We aim to provide access to information and material
  to support the establishment and expansion of RSE positions and
  groups within the research ecosystem including the material for
  making business justifications for RSEs.

## 4. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

  We will actively promote, encourage, and improve diversity throughout the
  broader US Research Software Engineer Community consistent with our full DEI
  mission statement. We will ensure we provide an inclusive environment with
  equitable treatment for all and we will prioritize a program of Diversity,
  Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) activities for our organization, led by a
  dedicated team of active community members.
