The US-RSE Association is centered around three main goals.  We aim
to target our activities and actions to serving these three aspects:



## 1. Community 

  We seek to provide a coherent association of those who identify with
  the role (not necessarily title) of Research Software Engineer based
  on our [inclusive definition]({{site.url}}/what-is-an-rse).  This
  group aims to provide the members of the community the ability to
  share knowledge, professional connections, and resources.

## 2. Advocacy

  We aim to promote RSEs' impact on research, highlighting the
  increasingly critical and valuable role RSEs serve.

## 3. Resources 

  We strive to provide useful resources to multiple demographics.
  For current and future RSEs we strive to provide technical and
  career development resources to support their professional
  development.  We aim to provide access to information and material
  to support the establishment and expansion of RSE positions and
  groups within the research ecosystem including the material for
  making business justifications for RSEs.
