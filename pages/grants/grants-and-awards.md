## Community and Travel Funds

### Overview

Part of the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant](https://us-rse.org/2023-04-27-sloan-grant-initiatives/)
for US-RSE has been allocated for the Community
and Travel Funds program. The goals of this program are to:

- Grow and diversify the US-RSE community and larger RSE community
- Connect people within the US-RSE community
- Assist individuals to grow in their own career
- Increase visibility and viability of Research Software Engineering as a career
- Create opportunities for underserved community members

Applications fall into two categories:

- **Community**: These benefit a group of individuals within the community
  (e.g., hosting a regional group meetup)
- **Individual**: These benefit an individual applicant (e.g., travel reimbursement)


To this end, we are accepting applications to provide funding from $100-$10,000
per proposal (with most expected to be up to $2,500) to support members in
activities such as, but not limited to:

- Activities for local RSE or affinity-group events: costs for space rental, refreshments, supplies, or child care.
- Hosting technical training events: costs for cloud computing or software services (for training on specialized tools), space rental, speaker fees.
- Hosting non-technical training activities such as mentor training and DEI-focused events.
- Attendance at tech industry or domain-specific academic conferences to share RSE work, discuss research software engineering, or host RSE networking events; costs for conference registration and travel support.
- Software to create videos, podcasts, or other media to share information about research software engineering or support RSE career development.
- Having US-RSE sponsor non-US-RSE events, such as other conferences, where sponsorship would be an effective advertisement and outreach mechanism.
- Pursuing individual professional development that could benefit the community, such as obtaining trainer certifications.
- Technical infrastructure costs related to working group activities (e.g., A/V services).

Applications are accepted on a quarterly basis. They are evaluated based on
potential for positive impact on the community, alignment to the US-RSE mission,
availability (or lack thereof) of funding, and the submitting members’
qualifications, including previous US-RSE activity.

Funded applicants are expected to provide a short report (a paragraph or two)
to be included on US-RSE’s website as a blog post or part of the newsletter.

If you have questions, please send them via email to [grants@us-rse.org](mailto:grants@us-rse.org)
or ask in the [`#community-grants`](https://app.slack.com/client/T8ZT4PJSW/C05M3F8FH08) Slack channel.
