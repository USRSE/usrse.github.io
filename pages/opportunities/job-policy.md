We happily post RSE and RSE-related job openings as a service to our community.
There is currently no fee associated with posting to the [US-RSE job board]({{ site.baseurl }}/jobs/).
We encourage RSE and RSE-related posts from all organization types (e.g. academic, industry, national labs, non-profits, etc.).
We expect any posted job to be open to individuals based in the United States.
Non-US based postings will be considered, provided they are open to applicants from the United States.

Each post will be reviewed for applicability to the US-RSE community.
Jobs are considered applicable, regardless of title, if they contain a significant amount of Research Software Engineering as a core responsibility/requirement or are sufficiently adjacent to Research Software Engineering that some Research Software Engineers would be qualified and potentially interested.
US-RSE organizers and maintainers reserve the right to not post a submitted job if it is deemed inappropriate or inapplicable.  

Jobs can be submitted through the [US-RSE job submission google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYK64R1c0rj-ERldGLxuqedLIbsYPZXj9uBplDRYNmnND10Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).
Once submitted, we will make every effort to review your submission quickly.
If it is appropriate for our job board it should be posted within a few business days.
