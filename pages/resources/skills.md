subtitle: Skills Used by RSEs
---

The following is a list of skills that an RSE might possess. The US-RSE Education and Training Group maintains and publishes this list in an effort to provide resources to better define RSE roles and to help direct individuals looking to invest in learning new skills. An RSE typically has experience with a subset of these skills. This list can be used to create a profile or job description, help individual identify topics they wish to learn, and (eventually) provide links to relevant training resources. This list is a work in progress. If you have additions or suggestions for topics or existing training resources, please either create a pull request or contact the [US-RSE Training and Education Working Group](({{ site.baseurl }}/about/working-groups/)).

The list was originally developed as part of the 2nd International RSE Leaders Workshop held in 2020. It is based off of the analysis of several job postings as well as crowd sourced.

This list has the following categories:
- [Software Development](#software-development)
- [User Interface](#user-interface)
- [Areas of CS](#areas-of-cs)
- [Domain-Specific Topics](#domain-specific-topics)
- [Around Software](#around-software)
- [Data Management Systems/Information Storage Systems](#data-management-systemsinformation-storage-systems)
- [Data](#data)
- [People-Related](#people-related)
- [Research Output](#research-output)
- [Community](#community)
- [Other](#other)
