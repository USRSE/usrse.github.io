subtitle: A Developing List of Useful Links to Learn Research Software Engineering
---

The US-RSE Education & Training Working Group has started an effort to compile a list of
useful videos, tutorials, and other training materials well suited for learning Research Software Engineering topics. The material ranges from beginner up through and including advanced topics.
An incomplete list is below.
We expect this list to grow significantly in both content and usability.
These links are provided as a service to the US Research Software Engineer community.
While we have made every effort to ensure these have been reviewed and vetted for applicability and appropriateness, US-RSE does not formally endorse any content below.

_Additions to this list or general comments/questions should be directed to the [US-RSE Training and Education Working Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/working-groups/)._



## Curated Lists, Collections, and Multi-Topic Courses/Books
These sites have multiple RSE-related links, potentially on a number of topics.
Rather than reporoduce, we list them here:
