       <h2 class="block-title">What is US-RSE?</h2>
       <p>The US Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE) is a community-driven effort that brings together people who write and contribute to research software within the US.
       We aim to build a connective, supportive, and diverse community of individuals from universities, laboratories, knowledge institutes, companies, and other enterprises.
       We strive to advocate for our members, raise awareness of the importance of the RSE role, and actively improve diversity within the RSE profession.
       We welcome all (including those outside the US) who support our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/mission/">organizational mission</a>, especially those who identify as RSEs, those interested in a career as an RSE, and those who may not be RSEs but consider themselves RSE “allies” or manage individuals in RSE roles.</p>

       <h2 class="block-title">Great ideas deserve great software.</h2>
       <p>Research Software Engineers use expertise in programming to advance research.
      This includes researchers who spend a significant amount of time programming, full-time software engineers writing code to solve research problems, and those somewhere in-between. We aspire to apply the skills and practices of software development to research to create more robust, manageable, and sustainable research software.</p>
