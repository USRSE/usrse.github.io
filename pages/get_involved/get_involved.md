The US-RSE Association is a new organization that needs community involvement to grow and mature.  


{% include notification.html message="Most of our interaction is via Slack: usrse.slack.com.  You'll receive a link to join the Slack space when you [join US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/join/).  If you have already joined US-RSE but can't get into Slack, email contact@us-rse.org for help." %}


Below are some ways members can get more involved in building this organization. Have additional ideas for a working group,  committee, or something else, but aren’t sure how to get started? The Steering Committee would be happy to help. Reach out on Slack (@sc) or email [contact@us-rse.org](mailto:contact@us-rse.org).

# One-Time Contribution

### Tweet about RSE things

The @us_rse Twitter account exists, but we need people to post/retweet content and engage with others.  If you’d like to do this for a week, a special event, or on an ongoing part-time basis (we can establish a rotating schedule), we’d love to have you.  If you have other ideas about using social media, we need your help too.

* **Get involved**: Join the #socialmedia channel on Slack and share your idea or volunteer to tweet


### Organize a Community Call

We are aiming to have community calls at least quarterly, but we need help planning and organizing them.  Can you take the lead organizing an upcoming call?  

* **Get involved**: Join the #communitycalls channel on Slack


### Volunteer to tell your RSE Story
