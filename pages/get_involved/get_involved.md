The US-RSE Association is a new organization that needs community involvement to grow and mature.

We offer individual membership and we will soon start the pilot phase for organizational membership that will give organizations the opportunity to be recognized in perpetuity as founding members of US-RSE.

{% include notification.html message="Most of our interaction is via Slack: usrse.slack.com.  You'll receive a link to join the Slack space when you [join US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/join/).  If you have already joined US-RSE but can't get into Slack, email contact@us-rse.org for help." %}


Below are some ways members can get more involved in building this organization. Have additional ideas for a working group,  committee, or something else, but aren’t sure how to get started? The Steering Committee would be happy to help. Reach out on Slack (@sc) or email [contact@us-rse.org](mailto:contact@us-rse.org).

# One-Time Contribution

### Tweet about RSE things

The @us_rse Twitter account exists, but we need people to post/retweet content and engage with others.  If you’d like to do this for a week, a special event, or on an ongoing part-time basis (we can establish a rotating schedule), we’d love to have you.  If you have other ideas about using social media, we need your help too.

* **Get involved**: Join the #socialmedia channel on Slack and share your idea or volunteer to tweet


### Organize a Community Call

We are aiming to have community calls at least quarterly, but we need help planning and organizing them.  Can you take the lead organizing an upcoming call?  

* **Get involved**: Join the #communitycalls channel on Slack


### Volunteer to tell your RSE Story

### Lead Outreach Efforts

Our community is growing, but we want to make sure all US RSEs know about us.  Have ideas for finding and reaching out to RSEs?  Interested in organizing local events to spread the word?  We need someone to take the lead on organizing outreach efforts.

* **Get involved:** Join the #wg-outreach channel on Slack and share your ideas or contact @or-wg (Outreach working group) or @sc on Slack (Steering Committee)
