A community whitepaper is a living document that represents a community effort
to discuss a question or idea. We call it "living" because we encourage community
members to edit and contribute to the documents over time, so there isn't
a "publish" date associated with it. For this reason, we use [the wiki](https://github.com/USRSE/usrse.github.io/wiki) associated
with the repository here.

You can read about how to clone and contribute to the documents <a href="https://github.com/USRSE/usrse.github.io/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>.
