throughout the profession. US-RSE envisions a future where it plays an essential
role in promoting RSEs to be universally respected for advancing science,
technology, and society through the transformative power of research software
engineering.

### Organizational Membership Duration

Organizational membership is defined per calendar year from January 1 to
December 31.
Organizations can join throughout the year with membership fees being reduced
between August 1 and November 30 to 50% for the remainder of the year and
reduced benefits as described below.
Members joining on or after December 1 will be members the following year from
January 1 with all benefits.


### Benefits for Organizational Founding Members

Organizational Founding Members will be recognized with their logo on the US-RSE
website, on conference material, and in annual reports.
Organizational members benefit from opportunities to help shape US-RSE’s
activities and strategic initiatives via quarterly meetings with the US-RSE
Leadership including the Executive Director (ED), Community Manager (CM) and a
subset of the elected Steering Committee (SC).

US-RSE’s organizational membership model has three tiers with different
membership fees (see Table 3).
As the second most visited page (after the homepage) on the website, the job
board is highly successful, and Standard and Premier membership include
highlighted job postings.
Our annual conference is the flagship event for RSEs and allies in the United
States, and Standard and Premier membership includes free registrations at the
event (see Table 1 for the summary of benefits).

Organizations joining before August 1 in coming years receive all benefits for
that year.
For Standard and Premier members this includes benefits for the annual
conference in the current calendar year.
Organizations joining on or after August 1 but before December 1 pay half of the
membership fee for the calendar year, but for Standard and Premier level will
not receive conference-related benefits and will only receive half as many
highlighted posts on the job board.
They will have all other benefits including the remaining quarterly meetings
with the US-RSE leadership group (see Table 2 for the summary of benefits).
Organizations joining on or after December 1 receive the membership for the
following year.


### Annual General Meeting and Annual Report

US-RSE holds a virtual Annual General Meeting open to all individual and
organizational members in December of each year.
Organizational members will be acknowledged in the meeting.
Organizational members will additionally  receive an annual end-of-the-year
report, which includes a directory of all organizational members.


### US-RSE Organizational Membership is inclusive

US-RSE prioritizes diversity, equity, and inclusion through initiatives that
cultivate a representative and inclusive RSE community.
It aims at creating and maintaining a diverse workforce.
The membership model is designed to give all interested organizations the
possibility to become an organizational founding member if joining by
December 1, 2025.
Besides the benefits listed in Table 1 and Table 2, US-RSE provides the
following opportunities:
