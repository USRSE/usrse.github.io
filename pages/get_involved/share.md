Have something to share with the US-RSE Community?  This guide can help you find the right communication channel to share your information.  


### *I want to share a...*

### Question

If you need US-RSE leadership to answer:

*   Slack: contact or tag @sc
*   Not Slack: email [contact@us-rse.org](mailto:contact@us-rse.org) 

If you want to engage the community:

*   Post it on the #general Slack channel to start a discussion; please do **not** tag the channel by using @channel or @here.

---

### Job Posting

*   Post it in the #jobs channel on Slack.
*   Add it to the website.  See [How do I add a job?](https://github.com/USRSE/usrse.github.io#2-how-do-i-add-a-job) or ask on the #jobs Slack channel if someone can help you post it.
    *   Jobs posted on the website will be included in the quarterly email newsletter if they’re still open when it’s sent.
*   Ask @tweeters on Slack to tweet it; it helps to post it on the website first so we have the info, or tweet it first yourself and tag @us_rse.

What jobs are relevant: any position in the US, or open to US applicants, requiring software development/programming skills and related to research in any area; can be any sector: academic, commercial, government, non-profit.

### Event

Share the information:

*   Post information about the event to the #events channel on Slack.
*   Tag @sc on Slack and ask for it to be added to the [Calendar](https://us-rse.org/calendar/) and/or the [Events & Training page](https://us-rse.org/events-training/).
*   Ask @tweeters on Slack to tweet it; make sure we have a URL or event info to share.
*   We’ll include upcoming events in the quarterly email newsletter.

Discussing and organizing:

*   It's OK to ping the #general channel on Slack to get a discussion started.  Create an event-specific channel on Slack if discussion on #events or #general grows; announce the new channel on #general.
*   Consider trying to organize a meetup for US-RSE members if you’re going to an event where other RSEs are likely to be.  If you do organize a meetup, let @sc on Slack know so we can promote it and share it as another distinct event.

What events are relevant: conferences, workshops, webinars, etc. on research software related topics.

### Resource, Link, or Paper

*   Write a post on your own blog about it and make sure your blog is part of the [community blog](https://us-rse.org/blog/); see the [instructions](https://github.com/USRSE/blog) or ping @sc for help adding it.  We try to highlight community blog posts in our quarterly email newsletter.
*   Share the resource on the Slack #general or #random channel depending on how relevant you think it is to the community.
*   Think it belongs on [Links](https://us-rse.org/links/)? Ping @sc on Slack or join the #website channel to discuss.

What’s relevant: use your judgment.  If you find it interesting and think other RSEs would, it’s probably something good to share on Slack.  If your blog has non-RSE content, there are [instructions](https://github.com/USRSE/blog/blob/master/README.md) for how to use tags to filter the feed to the community blog.

### Project or Code

*   Create a repository under your own GitHub account, or other code sharing site, and share a link or start a discussion on Slack.
*   Looking for collaborators?  Start a discussion on Slack.  Create a new channel if it helps.
*   Want a project to become a US-RSE sponsored activity?  Contact the Steering Committee (Slack @sc or [contact@us-rse.org](mailto:contact@us-rse.org)) to discuss how it fits with US-RSE current priorities, how the US-RSE can sustain it, and how it benefits US-RSE members. 

What’s relevant: for sharing your work and ideas, if it’s in line with the [Code of Conduct](https://us-rse.org/code-of-conduct), share it!  We want to see what US-RSE members are working on.  For US-RSE sponsored projects or activities, it’s important that multiple US-RSE members be involved in actively supporting the project for it to be sustainable and relevant as an association activity.

### Something Else?  Not Sure?

*   Post about it on the #general Slack channel.
*   Contact @sc on Slack to discuss it.
*   Email [contact@us-rse.org](mailto:contact@us-rse.org) to contact the Steering Committee.
