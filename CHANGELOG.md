# CHANGELOG

This file originally listed all non-trivial changes to Beautiful Jekyll, and
now serves to list changes for the usrse site.

## What constitutes a change?

Changelogs usually describe significant changes that future developers might want to
know about. In the case of a website, these are far fewer than for a software repository.
Examples of changes to include here might be adding an entire new section, 
re-organizing or restyling, or anything that changes a state to something different. 
Changes that aren't necessary to add are small bug fixes, content tweaks, etc. 

## How do I know if I should include my change?

There isn't a definitive rule, and it comes down to the intuition of a contributor,
and reviewers that are discussing the change. If you or your reviewers think that
a change warrants adding a line to the log, you should add it.
